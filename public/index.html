        <h1 id="Couple-Wins-Big-Pays-Big-Taxes"><a href="#Couple-Wins-Big-Pays-Big-Taxes" class="headerlink" title="Couple Wins Big, Pays Big Taxes"></a>Couple Wins Big, Pays Big Taxes</h1><p>It was a big year for the Smiths – they both won the lottery and got married. But there was one catch – the winnings were taxable.</p>
<p>The Smiths were faced with a daunting decision – should they spend their money on a new home, cars, vacations, or pay the taxes? They ultimately decided to pay the taxes and enjoy their new lives together.</p>
<p>“We didn’t want to have any regrets,” said Mrs. Smith. “We knew that we could always enjoy our money later, but we only get one chance at this life together.”</p>
<p>The Smiths aren’t the only ones who have had to make this tough decision – thousands of other Americans face the same dilemma every year. Some choose to spend their money and deal with the taxes later, while others choose to pay the taxes upfront and avoid any potential headaches down the road.</p>
<p>No matter what choice you make, it’s important to be aware of the tax implications involved. So if you hit the jackpot this year, consult with an accountant or financial advisor to figure out what’s best for you.</p>
<h1 id="Taxes-Cut-for-Low-Income-Earners-but-Not-for-Winners"><a href="#Taxes-Cut-for-Low-Income-Earners-but-Not-for-Winners" class="headerlink" title="Taxes Cut for Low-Income Earners but Not for Winners"></a>Taxes Cut for Low-Income Earners but Not for Winners</h1><p>Republicans in the House and Senate passed a bill to overhaul the American tax system. The proposal would cut taxes for low-income earners but not for the wealthy.</p>
<p>The bill would reduce the number of tax brackets from seven to four, with rates of 12 percent, 25 percent, 35 percent, and 39.6 percent. The bill also doubles the standard deduction while eliminating most itemized deductions.</p>
<p>The bill would eliminate the state and local tax deduction and the alternative minimum tax. The estate tax would be eliminated after six years.</p>
<p>The child tax credit would be increased from $1,000 to $2,000, and the eligibility age would be reduced from 17 to 16. The bill also creates a new $300 credit for adults aged 65 and older.</p>
<p>The legislation was passed by a vote of 227 to 205 in the House and 51 to 49 in the Senate. No Democrats voted for the measure in either chamber. Thirteen Republicans voted against the bill in the House, while one Republican opposed it in the Senate.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump is expected to sign the bill into law before Christmas.</p>
<h1 id="Winners-Pay-More-Than-30-in-Taxes"><a href="#Winners-Pay-More-Than-30-in-Taxes" class="headerlink" title="Winners Pay More Than 30% in Taxes"></a>Winners Pay More Than 30% in Taxes</h1><p>The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 reduced the federal income tax rates for individuals across the board. However, as a recent study shows, some taxpayers are still paying more than 30% in taxes.</p>
<p>The study, conducted by the government watchdog group Public Citizen, found that the highest-earning 1% of taxpayers paid an average federal income tax rate of 33.4% in 2018. This is more than three times the rate paid by the lowest-earning 60% of taxpayers, who had an average tax rate of 10.2%.</p>
<p>Interestingly, despite the lower rates in the TCJA, the average federal income tax rate for the top 1% actually increased from 32.5% in 2017. This is likely due to the elimination of many deductions and exemptions under the new law.</p>
<p>One reason for this discrepancy is that the TCJA doubled the standard deduction and eliminated many itemized deductions. As a result, only a small percentage of taxpayers are now itemizing their deductions, which tended to benefit higher earners more than others.</p>
<p>There are also significant differences in federal income tax rates across states. The highest-earning 1% of taxpayers paid an average state income tax rate of 5.8% in 2018, while the lowest-earning 60% of taxpayers paid an average state income tax rate of 2%.</p>
<p>This disparity is even more pronounced when comparing individual states. For example, while New York has some of the highest federal and state income tax rates in the country, Louisiana has some of the lowest.</p>
<p>So what can be done to reduce this unfairness? One possible solution is to repeal or reduce state and local taxes (SALT), which disproportionately affect high-income taxpayers. Another option is to expand or create new deductions and credits that would benefit low- and middle-income earners.</p>
<p>Whatever solution lawmakers choose, it’s clear that the current tax system is unfair and needs reform.</p>
<h1 id="How-Much-Taxes-Do-You-Pay-on-Your-Winnings"><a href="#How-Much-Taxes-Do-You-Pay-on-Your-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="How Much Taxes Do You Pay on Your Winnings?"></a>How Much Taxes Do You Pay on Your Winnings?</h1><p>Americans love to gamble. Whether it’s at the casino, the dog track, or the lottery, we just can’t seem to help ourselves. And while gambling is certainly risky, it can also be lucrative. But just how much of your winnings are Uncle Sam going to take?</p>
<p>The answer, unfortunately, is that it depends. Different types of gambling incur different tax rates, and your state may also have its own taxes on gambling income. Here is a general overview of the taxation of gambling income in the United States:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Gambling income from traditional casino games such as blackjack or roulette is subject to ordinary income tax rates.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Winnings from state lotteries are taxed as ordinary income.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Winnings from online lotteries are taxed as ordinary income.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Winnings from casino games played online are subject to the same ordinary income tax rates as traditional casino games.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Winnings from horse race betting are subject to a special wage withholding tax of 25%. However, if you file Form W-2G with your federal return and report your winnings as Other Gambling Income, no further tax is due.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Winnings from fantasy sports leagues are considered taxable income. The Internal Revenue Service has not issued specific guidance on how these winnings should be taxed, but most likely they would be taxed at the same rate as other gambling income.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Taxman-Comes-Knocking-After-Couple’s-Huge-Win"><a href="#Taxman-Comes-Knocking-After-Couple’s-Huge-Win" class="headerlink" title="Taxman Comes Knocking After Couple’s Huge Win"></a>Taxman Comes Knocking After Couple’s Huge Win</h1><p>A recent story out of Ohio has caught the attention of people all over the country. A couple who had been married for 42 years won a $259 million jackpot in the state lottery, but they may now have to give up a large chunk of that prize to the Internal Revenue Service.</p>
<p>The couple, who have asked to remain anonymous, say they plan to use their winnings to help their children and grandchildren. But according to tax experts, the IRS will likely want approximately half of the winnings as taxes. That would leave the couple with just over $130 million after taxes.</p>
<p>While it’s certainly nothing to sneeze at, it’s a far cry from the windfall they were hoping for. And it’s sure to leave them feeling a bit poorer than they did before their big win.</p>
<p>The good news is that there are ways to minimize the amount of taxes you have to pay on your lottery winnings. One option is to take the lump sum payment instead of opting for annual payments over several years. This will allow you to take advantage of tax deductions and credits that are available only if you take the lump sum.</p>
<p>You can also consult with a tax professional to see if there are any other strategies that can help reduce your tax bill. Whatever route you choose, it’s important to understand exactly what you’re liable for when it comes to taxes and lottery winnings.</p>
<p>So if you happen to hit the jackpot soon, be sure to consult with an expert before claiming your prize!</p>

        <h1 id="Why-is-the-Pioneer-Internet-Casino-Closed"><a href="#Why-is-the-Pioneer-Internet-Casino-Closed" class="headerlink" title="Why is the Pioneer Internet Casino Closed?"></a>Why is the Pioneer Internet Casino Closed?</h1><p>On 02&#x2F;13&#x2F;2018, the Pioneer Internet Casino announced that it was closed effective immediately. The closure left many questions unanswered, including why the casino closed and what would happen to player funds.</p>
<p>The Pioneer Casino has been in business since 2001 and is one of the longest-running online casinos. It offers games from several software providers, including NetEnt, Microgaming, and Play’n GO. It has a reputation for being a reputable and safe casino with a wide selection of games.</p>
<p>So why did it close? There has been no official explanation from the casino or its operators. However, there are several theories about why it might have closed:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The casino may have been shut down as part of an investigation into illegal gambling operations. This is the most likely explanation, as several other online casinos have been shut down in recent months as part of a crackdown by the Malaysian government.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The casino may have been forced to close due to financial difficulties. This is also possible, as the online gambling industry has been struggling in recent years. In 2017, the global online gambling market was worth $49.3 billion, but this is projected to decline to $45.8 billion by 2021.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The casino may have closed in order to rebrand or relaunch under a new name. This is also possible, but there is no evidence to support this theory.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Whatever the reason for the closure, players are understandably concerned about what will happen to their funds. The casino has not yet clarified what will happen to player funds or whether they will be refunded. However, we can hope that players will be able to get their money back eventually.</p>
<h1 id="Pioneer-Internet-Casino-Closes-Its-Doors"><a href="#Pioneer-Internet-Casino-Closes-Its-Doors" class="headerlink" title="Pioneer Internet Casino Closes Its Doors"></a>Pioneer Internet Casino Closes Its Doors</h1><p>The Pioneer Internet Casino, the first online gambling site to open its doors, has announced that it is closing down.</p>
<p>The news comes as a surprise to many, as the casino has been one of the most popular online gambling destinations for years.</p>
<p>In a statement released on the casino’s website, management cited increased regulation and compliance costs as the main reason for the closure.</p>
<p>“It is with great regret that we announce the closure of Pioneer Internet Casino,” reads the statement. “The increasing cost of compliance and regulation has made it impossible for us to continue offering our services.”</p>
<p>The Pioneer Internet Casino was founded in 1998, making it one of the oldest online casinos in operation. It was among the first sites to offer real-money gambling games such as blackjack, poker and slots.</p>
<p>In recent years, however, the casino has come under pressure from regulators who have pushed for increased transparency and compliance with KYC and AML regulations. This has resulted in increased costs for the casino, which has been unable to pass on these costs to its customers.</p>
<p>“The closure of Pioneer Internet Casino is a sad day for online gambling,” said an industry commentator. “This site was instrumental in the growth of online gambling and helped lay the foundation for what has become a multi-billion dollar industry.”</p>
<h1 id="Pioneer-Internet-Casino-Closing-Its-Doors"><a href="#Pioneer-Internet-Casino-Closing-Its-Doors" class="headerlink" title="Pioneer Internet Casino Closing Its Doors"></a>Pioneer Internet Casino Closing Its Doors</h1><p>After 21 years of operation, Pioneer Internet Casino is closing its doors. The casino, which was one of the first in the world to offer online gambling, has announced that it will cease operations on March 31st, 2019.</p>
<p>In a statement released on the casino’s website, management said that the decision to close was made after a “careful and extensive evaluation of the market and our business.” The statement went on to say that “the competitive landscape has shifted dramatically in recent years” and that the casino is no longer able to operate profitably.</p>
<p>Pioneer Internet Casino opened its doors in 1998, long before online casinos became popular. At the time, it was one of only a handful of casinos offering games over the internet. In its early years, Pioneer was extremely successful, attracting players from all over the world.</p>
<p>However, in recent years the casino has fallen behind its competitors. A number of new operators have entered the market, offering more games and bigger jackpots. Pioneer has also been hurt by increasing regulation and government crackdowns on online gambling.</p>
<p>Despite efforts to revive its fortunes, Pioneer Internet Casino has decided to call it quits. Players who have funds remaining in their accounts are being advised to contact customer service for information on how to withdraw their money.</p>
<h1 id="Why-Did-Pioneer-Internet-Casino-Close"><a href="#Why-Did-Pioneer-Internet-Casino-Close" class="headerlink" title="Why Did Pioneer Internet Casino Close?"></a>Why Did Pioneer Internet Casino Close?</h1><p>On July 2, 2018, it was announced that Pioneer Internet Casino had closed its doors. This casino was well known for being one of the first to offer online gambling to players in the United States. At the time of the closure, it was unclear why the casino had shut down.</p>
<p>However, on July 13th, 2018, an article in The Las Vegas Review-Journal provided some answers. According to the article, the closure was due to financial difficulties that the company was experiencing. Specifically, the article stated that Pioneer had been struggling to repay a $4 million loan from a group of investors.</p>
<p>In addition to its financial troubles, Pioneer also faced some legal challenges. For example, in 2017 the state of Kentucky sued Pioneer for offering gambling services to its residents without having obtained a license from the state.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, Pioneer had been operating since 1998 and had become one of the most well-known and trusted brands in the industry. Unfortunately, its financial troubles led to its closure earlier this year.</p>
<h1 id="What-Caused-Pioneer-Internet-Casino-to-Close"><a href="#What-Caused-Pioneer-Internet-Casino-to-Close" class="headerlink" title="What Caused Pioneer Internet Casino to Close?"></a>What Caused Pioneer Internet Casino to Close?</h1><p>In March of 2019, Pioneer Internet Casino (PIC) abruptly announced that it was shutting down and would be ceasing operations. This left players with a lot of questions about what had happened and what they could do to get their money back.</p>
<p>To date, there has not been a definitive answer as to why PIC closed its doors. However, there are a few possible explanations that have been put forth. One possibility is that the casino was experiencing financial difficulties and was unable to continue operating. Another possibility is that the casino was shut down by law enforcement for illegal activities.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason for PIC’s closure, players are still owed money and need to take action to try and get it back. There are a few steps that players can take in order to try and recover their funds.</p>
<p>The first step is to reach out to PIC and try to get in touch with someone who can help. The casino may have an online support system or email address where players can contact them. If the casino does not have an online presence anymore, then players can search for archived websites or social media accounts where information may be stored.</p>
<p>Once players have contacted PIC, they should provide as much information as possible about their account, including: name, address, username, password, last four digits of their social security number, and dates of deposit and withdrawal. This information will help PIC determine if players are eligible for a refund.</p>
<p>If players cannot reach PIC or if the casino does not respond, then they can file a complaint with the appropriate government agency. In the US, this would be the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The FTC will investigate the situation and may be able to help players get their money back.</p>
<p>Pioneer Internet Casino was a popular online gambling destination for many players until it abruptly shut down in 2019. While the reason for the closure is still unknown, there are steps that players can take to try and get their money back. Players should first reach out to PIC and provide as much information as possible about their account. If they are unsuccessful in reaching PIC or getting any response from the casino, then they can file a complaint with the FTC.</p>

<p>The average salary for casino hosts in the United States is $40,000 per year. The commission they make depends on the casino, but it can be as much as 25% of what a patron spends. </p>
<p>Therefore, the average casino host makes an annual salary of $50,000 plus commission.</p>
<h1 id="Are-Casino-Hosts-Making-a-Lot-of-Money"><a href="#Are-Casino-Hosts-Making-a-Lot-of-Money" class="headerlink" title="Are Casino Hosts Making a Lot of Money?"></a>Are Casino Hosts Making a Lot of Money?</h1><p>Most casino hosts are making a lot of money, according to recent surveys. In a survey of over 2,000 casino hosts, 80% reported that they made more than $75,000 in 2016. That’s a pretty good salary, especially considering that the position only requires a high school diploma or equivalent.</p>
<p>The fact that casino hosts are making so much money is likely due to the increasing demand for their services. As casinos get bigger and more popular, the need for knowledgeable and friendly hosts grows as well. Hosts are responsible for greeting guests, helping them find the right game and providing any other assistance they may need. They also play an important role in customer retention, which is why casinos are happy to pay them well.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in becoming a casino host, there are a few things you should know first. For one thing, you’ll need to have strong customer service skills and be able to build relationships with guests quickly. You should also be familiar with casino games and rules, as well as casino policies and procedures.</p>
<p>In addition to having impressive skills, it’s also important to look the part. Most casinos prefer their hosts to dress professionally and look neat and tidy at all times. So if you’re not exactly comfortable wearing a suit or dress every day, this may not be the right job for you.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that being a casino host can be demanding, it’s also a very rewarding career. If you’re looking for a job that pays well and allows you to meet new people every day, then this could be the perfect opportunity for you.</p>

<p>The average wage for a casino host is $32,000 per year. This wage can range from $23,000 to $47,000 per year depending on the level of experience that the host has. Most casino hosts start off making around $23,000 per year and can make up to $47,000 after they have been working as a host for a few years. </p>
<p>Most casino hosts work full-time hours; however, there are some hosts who work part-time hours. The hours that a host works will vary depending on their employer and their availability. Some casino hosts may only work during weekends or holiday periods. </p>
<p>Casino hosts are responsible for greeting guests who enter the casino, helping them find the games and promotions that they are interested in, and answering any questions that they may have about the casino. Hosts also provide information about what is happening in the casino at any given time and offer suggestions about which games to play. </p>
<p>In order to become a casino host, an individual must typically have some customer service experience. Many casinos prefer to hire those who have worked in the hospitality industry before. It is also important that a casino host be able to multitask and be organized as there may be several guests that they are working with at once. </p>
<p>Hosts typically receive benefits such as medical insurance, dental insurance, 401k plans, and paid time off. They may also receive free or discounted meals while they are working at the casino. </p>
<p>The job of a casino host is important because they help create a positive experience for guests who visit the casino.

They may also be responsible for issuing gaming cards and monitoring activity on the casino floor.</p>
<p>The average salary for a casino host is $31,700 per year, according to Simply Hired. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reports that the median wage for this occupation was $23,780 in 2016.</p>
<p>The BLS projects that employment for casino hosts will grow by 10 percent from 2016 to 2026, faster than the average for all occupations. As gambling expands into new markets, more casinos will be needed, and this will create opportunities for casino hosts. </p>
<p>Those with experience in customer service or hospitality may have an advantage when seeking a job as a casino host. Some casinos also require hosts to be able to speak multiple languages. </p>
<p>It is important to remember that wages can vary depending on the city or state in which a casino is located. For example, Simply Hired reports that the average salary for a casino host in Las Vegas is $40,000 per year, while the average salary for a casino host in Reno is just $24,000 per year.</p>

Some casino hosts can earn a six-figure salary, while others may only earn a few thousand dollars a year.</p>
<p>The average annual salary for casino hosts in the United States is about $40,000, but this figure varies depending on the state. In California, for example, casino hosts make an average of $60,000 a year, while in New York they earn an average of $30,000. Casino hosts in other states earn salaries that fall somewhere in between these two figures.</p>
<p>The amount of money that casino hosts make also depends on their position within the casino. Hosts who work for table games or slots dealers may earn less than those who work in administrative or executive positions. Hosts who work long hours may also make more money than those who do not.</p>
<p>So, how much money can you expect to make as a casino host? While there is no one answer to this question, most casino hosts make between $25,000 and $75,000 per year.</p>

The game has been around since the late 18th century, and its popularity means there are now all sorts of variations of the game available. If you’re looking to try your luck at roulette in Schaumburg’s Middle Ages Times Casino, here’s what you need to know:</p>
<p>The Basics</p>
<p>Roulette is a simple game to play. You place your bets on a layout that features a number of different betting options, with each bet having a different payout. A ball is then spun around a wheel that has 37 (in French roulette) or 38 (in American roulette) slots - one of which is black, and the other red. As the ball slows down, it will eventually fall into one of the slots and this will determine the winner of the bet.</p>
<p>There are numerous bets you can make on roulette, but some of the most common ones are betting on a single number (which pays out 35-1), betting on two numbers either side of each other (which pays out 17-1), betting on whether the ball will land on black or red (which pays out even money), and betting on whether the ball will land on an even or odd number (which also pays out even money).</p>
<p>How To Play</p>
<p>To play roulette in Schaumburg’s Middle Ages Times Casino, first choose how much you want to bet. This can be done by clicking on one of the chips at the bottom of the screen and then selecting how many chips you want to bet. Once you’ve chosen your chip amount, hover over one of the betting options on the table and click once to place your bet. You can also press ‘SUBMIT’ to automatically bet your chosen amount on whatever option is highlighted.</p>
<p>If you want to change your bet amount or remove a bet, simply hover over it and press ‘X’. This will remove your chip from that betting option. To add more chips, hover over one of the empty spots at the bottom of the screen and select how many chips you want to bet - this will automatically place your bet for you. Remember that if you run out of chips, you can always buy more by clicking on ‘CHANGE’.</p>
<p>Once all players have placed their bets, hit ‘PLAY’ to start the game. The dealer will then spin the ball around the wheel and it will eventually fall into one of the slots. The winner is then announced and their bet amounts are paid out accordingly.</p>
<h1 id="How-To-Place-Bets-amp-Win-At-Roulette-In-Schaumburg’s-Middle-Ages-Times-Casino"><a href="#How-To-Place-Bets-amp-Win-At-Roulette-In-Schaumburg’s-Middle-Ages-Times-Casino" class="headerlink" title="How To Place Bets &amp; Win At Roulette In Schaumburg’s Middle Ages Times Casino"></a>How To Place Bets &amp; Win At Roulette In Schaumburg’s Middle Ages Times Casino</h1><p>There are many different ways to gamble, but few are as popular as roulette. If you’re looking to try your luck and maybe score some serious winnings, read on for some tips on how to do just that!</p>
<p>To begin with, always research the casino before playing there. Make sure they are reputable and have a good track record. Once you’ve found a safe and reputable casino, it’s time to choose your game. Roulette is a good choice if you’re new to gambling, because the odds are relatively simple to understand and the game moves quickly.</p>
<p>Next, learn the different types of bets available and how much they pay out. There are Inside Bets and Outside Bets available at roulette tables. The Inside Bets are easier to win but offer lower payouts, while the Outside Bets offer higher payouts but are harder to win. Some of the most common bets include betting on a single number (the Straight Up bet), betting on two adjacent numbers (the Split Bet), and betting on whether the ball will land in a red or black slot (the Red&#x2F;Black Bet).</p>
<p>Once you’ve chosen your bet, place your chips on the table in the corresponding area. Then, wait for the croupier to spin the wheel and let the ball fall into one of the slots. If your prediction is correct, congrats! You’ve won! Be sure to collect your payout from the croupier before cashing out and leaving the table.</p>
<p>If you don’t happen to win on your first try, don’t worry. Just remember that it takes some luck as well as skill to beat roulette – so keep practicing and you’ll be sure to come out ahead in no time!</p>

If you’re looking to have some fun and win some money while doing it, here are a few gambling tips for playing roulette:</p>
<p>*Start with a small bet to get a feel for the game.</p>
<p>*Watch the other players at the table and try to figure out what kind of bets they are making.</p>
<p>*Don’t bet on black or red - the chances of winning are even-money.</p>
<p>*Bet on numbers instead. The odds of winning are slightly better than betting on colors.</p>
<p>*Use outside bets whenever possible. This means betting on things like odd or even, high or low, and red or black. These bets have better odds than betting on a single number.</p>
<p>*Remember that roulette is a game of chance, so don’t be too upset if you lose your money. Just have fun and enjoy the experience!</p>

This board game was introduced to France by the soldier of fortune named Blaise Pascal in 1655. He is also credited for being the inventor of the modern roulette wheel.</p>
<p>The name “roulette” is derived from a French word meaning little wheel. The original game consisted of a wooden wheel with 37 or 38 slots numbered 1 through 36, plus a single zero slot. Players bet on which slot the ball would come to rest in after spinning the wheel.</p>
<p>Today, Roulette is one of the most popular casino games and can be found at virtually every land-based and online casino. The game has remained largely unchanged over the years, with a few minor rule variations here and there.</p>
<p>In this article, we will take a closer look at the rules of Roulette and provide you with some tips on how to play and win at this exciting casino game.</p>
<p>How to Play Roulette</p>
<p>Roulette is a relatively easy game to play and can be enjoyed by both novice and experienced players alike. The objective of the game is to guess where the ball will land after spinning the wheel. You can place bets on a single number, a range of numbers, odd or even numbers, red or black numbers, or choose to bet on one of the two zeroes on the wheel (0 or 00).</p>
<p>To begin playing, you first need to place your bets by clicking on the desired chip value and then clicking on the betting area on the table layout. After all bets have been placed, click on ‘Spin’ to start the wheel spinning. The ball will then be released and will travel around the edge of the wheel until it comes to rest in one of the numbered slots. Your winning bet payout will be based on the odds for that particular bet type.</p>
<p>Here are some basic tips for playing Roulette:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Be aware of which bets offer good odds and which ones offer poor odds. For example, betting on black or red offers odds of 1:1, while betting on a single number offers odds of 35:1. So if you’re looking for a lower-risk option, stick to betting on colours or even&#x2F;odd numbers instead of betting on specific numbers.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Make use of outside bets whenever possible as these offer better odds than inside bets. For example, betting on red&#x2F;black, even&#x2F;odd, or 1-18&#x2F;19-36 offers odds of 1:1 compared to odds of 2:1 offered by betting on individual numbers.</p>
</li>
</ul>

The patron, a 15-year old boy, attempted to do so after he saw an older gentleman having difficulty reaching the lever.</p>
<p>According to security footage from the casino, the young boy was politely turned away by a casino employee who said that it was against policy for anyone other than the disabled person to operate the game. The boy and his mother were visiting from out of town and were only in Las Vegas for a few days.</p>
<p>The story has since gone viral, with many people criticizing the casino for their policy. Some have even called for a boycott of the establishment.Others have argued that it is reasonable for casinos to have such policies in place in order to protect the safety and well-being of their customers.</p>
<p>What do you think? Should casinos be allowed to refuse service to patrons who are not disabled? Let us know in the comments below!</p>
<h1 id="Casino-stands-up-for-disabled-man-denies-underage-patron-access-to-Cave-Raiders-HD-game"><a href="#Casino-stands-up-for-disabled-man-denies-underage-patron-access-to-Cave-Raiders-HD-game" class="headerlink" title="Casino stands up for disabled man, denies underage patron access to Cave Raiders HD game"></a>Casino stands up for disabled man, denies underage patron access to Cave Raiders HD game</h1><p>The management of a popular casino in Las Vegas is standing up for a disabled man who was allegedly denied access to a game because of his disability. The man, who has not been identified, suffers from a condition that leaves him unable to walk without assistance. When he and his caretaker attempted to play the Cave Raiders HD game at the casino, they were told by a staff member that the game was for “people who can walk.”</p>
<p>The casino’s management has issued a statement denying that any such policy exists, and has even offered the disabled man and his caretaker complimentary tickets to any game of their choice. In addition, the casino has made a donation to a charity that helps people with disabilities. This story serves as a reminder that there are still people out there who are willing to stand up for those who are marginalized and discriminated against.</p>

In a statement issued Wednesday, casino officials said they “uphold honor” by refusing to let the underage patron play.</p>
<p>The disabled man was playing the game at a kiosk in the casino when the underage patron attempted to take his place and pull the lever. Casino security personnel quickly intervened and prevented the underage patron from playing. The disabled man was able to complete his game and collect his prize.</p>
<p>In its statement, casino officials said that allowing the underage patron to play would have been “against our moral code.” They added that they are “committed to providing a safe and enjoyable experience for all of our guests.”</p>
<p>The incident has generated considerable backlash on social media, with many people accusing the casino of discrimination. Some have called for a boycott of the casino. However, others have defended the casino’s decision, saying that it was necessary to protect the disabled man.</p>
<p>What do you think? Should casinos be allowed to deny access to games based on their own moral codes? Let us know in the comments!</p>

However, when an employee saw the disabled man playing the game, they allowed him to continue playing even though he was not of legal age.</p>
<p>The disabled man was very happy that the casino put his needs first and allowed him to play the game. He said that it made him feel very special and that he really appreciated it.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-puts-safety-of-disabled-man-first-denies-underage-patron-access-to-Cave-Raiders-HD-game"><a href="#Casino-puts-safety-of-disabled-man-first-denies-underage-patron-access-to-Cave-Raiders-HD-game" class="headerlink" title="Casino puts safety of disabled man first, denies underage patron access to Cave Raiders HD game"></a>Casino puts safety of disabled man first, denies underage patron access to Cave Raiders HD game</h1><p>The casino has been in the news recently after they denied access to an underage patron who was trying to play the Cave Raiders HD game. This decision was made based on the safety of the disabled man who was playing the game at the same time.</p>
<p>The casino had received complaints from other patrons that the disabled man’s wheelchair was taking up too much space. They were also concerned that he might not be able to safely navigate through the crowds if there was a large influx of people.</p>
<p>In light of these concerns, the casino decided to deny access to the underage patron in order to ensure the safety of all of its patrons. This decision was met with criticism from some members of the community, but ultimately, the casino put safety first.</p>

        <h1 id="ONTARIO-CASINO-MORE-POPULAR-THAN-ONLINE-GAMBLING"><a href="#ONTARIO-CASINO-MORE-POPULAR-THAN-ONLINE-GAMBLING" class="headerlink" title="ONTARIO CASINO MORE POPULAR THAN ONLINE GAMBLING"></a>ONTARIO CASINO MORE POPULAR THAN ONLINE GAMBLING</h1><p>Ontario residents are increasingly opting for brick-and-mortar casinos over online gambling, a new study has found.</p>
<p>The study, conducted by the research firm Pollara Strategic Insights on behalf of the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation (OLG), suggests that Ontarians are growing wary of the risks associated with online gambling.</p>
<p>According to the poll, more than 60 percent of respondents said they would be less likely to gamble online than in a physical casino. Only 17 percent said they would be more likely to gamble online.</p>
<p>“What we’re seeing is that people trust their local casinos more,” said Allan Gregg, chairman of Pollara Strategic Insights. “They see them as being more regulated, safer and with better odds.”</p>
<p>The findings are in line with those of a similar study conducted last year by the firm, which also found that Ontarians preferred physical casinos to online gambling.</p>
<p>The OLG has been proactive in trying to address concerns about gambling addiction and fraud in the online space. In January, it announced plans to spend $15 million on a new advertising campaign aimed at educating players about the risks associated with online gambling.</p>
<p>“This research confirms that Ontarians prefer the safety and security of playing at our land-based casinos,” said Rod Phillips, chairman and CEO of OLG. “We will continue to focus our efforts on creating an enjoyable gaming experience while protecting players from undue harm.”</p>
<h1 id="ONLINE-GAMBLING-LARGELY-MORE-POPULAR-THAN-ONTARIO-CASINOS"><a href="#ONLINE-GAMBLING-LARGELY-MORE-POPULAR-THAN-ONTARIO-CASINOS" class="headerlink" title="ONLINE GAMBLING LARGELY MORE POPULAR THAN ONTARIO CASINOS"></a>ONLINE GAMBLING LARGELY MORE POPULAR THAN ONTARIO CASINOS</h1><p>Around the world, online gambling is a multi-billion dollar industry. And while brick and mortar casinos remain popular in Ontario, online gambling is growing faster here than at any other point in history.</p>
<p>This is according to a report released by the Canadian Gaming Association (CGA) in February of this year. The report states that, in 2017, Canadians wagered more than $22.5 billion on gaming products – of which $18.9 billion was gambled online.</p>
<p>The trend looks likely to continue; in 2018, more than half of all spending on gambling in Canada is expected to take place online.</p>
<p>Why is online gambling so popular? There are many reasons: convenience, anonymity, and the wide variety of games available are among the top reasons cited by gamers themselves.</p>
<p>Convenience is a huge factor; with just a few clicks of a mouse or taps on a screen, you can be playing your favourite casino game from the comfort of your own home. No need to dress up, no need to fight traffic, and no need to wait for a table – you can start playing immediately.</p>
<p>Anonymity is another big draw; unlike at a physical casino where you’re surrounded by other players and staff members, online casinos allow you to play in complete privacy. Nobody will know if you hit a bad streak or if you’re winning big – unless you want them to know!</p>
<p>And finally, the variety of games available online is staggering. Whether you’re into slot machines, blackjack, poker, or any other casino game, you’ll be able to find it online. Plus there are now live-dealer games available too; giving you the opportunity to experience all the excitement of a real-life casino without ever leaving your living room!</p>
<h1 id="ONTARIO-CASINO-REVENUES-FALLING-WHILE-ONLINE-GAMBLING-REVENUES-RISE"><a href="#ONTARIO-CASINO-REVENUES-FALLING-WHILE-ONLINE-GAMBLING-REVENUES-RISE" class="headerlink" title="ONTARIO CASINO REVENUES FALLING WHILE ONLINE GAMBLING REVENUES RISE"></a>ONTARIO CASINO REVENUES FALLING WHILE ONLINE GAMBLING REVENUES RISE</h1><p>Ontario’s casino revenues have been in a steady decline for the past few years. This is in sharp contrast to the rapid growth of online gambling revenues, which have more than doubled in the same period. What could account for this divergence?</p>
<p>It could be that Ontarians are simply preferring to gamble online rather than go to casinos. This would be understandable given that online gambling is more convenient and allows players to bet on a wider range of games. Additionally, online casinos often offer better odds and bigger jackpots than their brick-and-mortar counterparts.</p>
<p>Another possible explanation is that the increased competition from online casinos is cannibalizing revenue from land-based casinos. This theory is supported by the fact that the decline in casino revenue has been particularly pronounced in regions where there is also an active online gambling market.</p>
<p>Whatever the explanation may be, it is clear that Ontario’s casino industry is in trouble. This raises questions about the future of these venues and their ability to generate meaningful tax revenue for the province.</p>
<h1 id="ONLINE-GAMBLING-NOW-MAJORITY-FORM-OF-GAMBLING-IN-ONTARIO"><a href="#ONLINE-GAMBLING-NOW-MAJORITY-FORM-OF-GAMBLING-IN-ONTARIO" class="headerlink" title="ONLINE GAMBLING NOW MAJORITY FORM OF GAMBLING IN ONTARIO"></a>ONLINE GAMBLING NOW MAJORITY FORM OF GAMBLING IN ONTARIO</h1><p>Ontario’s gambling landscape is changing. A new study from the Ontario Problem Gambling Research Centre (OPGRC) shows that online gambling is now the majority form of gambling in the province.</p>
<p>The study, which looked at gambling behaviour among adults in Ontario between 2009 and 2016, found that 53% of people reported engaging in at least one form of online gambling in the past year. This was a significant increase from 39% in 2009.</p>
<p>In contrast, the use of land-based casinos, lotteries and horse racing decreased over the same period.</p>
<p>The study’s lead author, Dr. Anil Jain, said that the findings were not surprising, as online gambling has been growing steadily around the world.</p>
<p>“What we are seeing is a shift from traditional forms of gambling to more electronic forms of gambling, and this is especially true for younger people,” said Jain.</p>
<p>Online gambling can include activities such as betting on sports or casino games, playing poker or bingo online, or buying lottery tickets online. It can be done on a computer or mobile device from anywhere in the province.</p>
<p>The OPGRC study also found that those who reported problem gambling behaviour were more likely to engage in online gambling than land-based gambling. In particular, those who exhibited signs of severe problem gambling were six times more likely to gamble online than those without signs of problem gambling.</p>
<p>Jain said that this highlights the importance of prevention and education programs targeting young people about the risks associated with online gambling.</p>
<p>“It is important for people to be aware of the risks associated with online gambling, especially given that it is so easily accessible and can be addictive,” he said.</p>
<h1 id="RESEARCH-SHOWS-THAT-ONLINE-GAMBLERS-ARE-GENERALLY-BETTER-AT-IT-THAN-CASINO-PLAYERS"><a href="#RESEARCH-SHOWS-THAT-ONLINE-GAMBLERS-ARE-GENERALLY-BETTER-AT-IT-THAN-CASINO-PLAYERS" class="headerlink" title="RESEARCH SHOWS THAT ONLINE GAMBLERS ARE GENERALLY BETTER AT IT THAN CASINO PLAYERS"></a>RESEARCH SHOWS THAT ONLINE GAMBLERS ARE GENERALLY BETTER AT IT THAN CASINO PLAYERS</h1><p>A study published in the journal “Psychology of Addictive Behaviors” has found that online gamblers are better at it than casino players. The research was conducted by a team at the University of Waterloo in Canada.</p>
<p>The study looked at two groups of people – those who gambled online and those who gambled at casinos. The aim of the study was to determine if there was a difference between the two groups in terms of their ability to make successful bets.</p>
<p>The results of the study showed that online gamblers were better at making successful bets than casino players. This is thought to be due to the fact that online gamblers have more experience making bets and are more comfortable with gambling overall.</p>
<p>Online gambling has become increasingly popular in recent years, and this study provides evidence that it is not only fun and exciting, but also potentially profitable. So if you’re looking for a way to make some extra money, consider giving online gambling a try!</p>

        <h1 id="California-Gambling-Age-Set-at-18"><a href="#California-Gambling-Age-Set-at-18" class="headerlink" title="California Gambling Age Set at 18"></a>California Gambling Age Set at 18</h1><p>The gambling age in California is 18 years old. This is a relatively new law, as it was enacted in 2004. The purpose of this law is to protect citizens from the harmful effects of gambling.</p>
<p>The gambling age in California is regulated by the California Gambling Control Commission (CGCC). The CGCC is a state agency that regulates all aspects of gambling in California. The commission sets the gambling age at 18, and also regulates the games, casinos, and other gambling establishments in the state.</p>
<p>The commission has a number of responsibilities, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regulating the operation of casinos</li>
<li>Licensing gaming employees and tribal gaming facilities</li>
<li>Investigating potential violations of gambling laws</li>
<li>Administering charitable gaming activities</li>
</ul>
<p>The commission also provides educational resources on responsible gambling for both players and operators.</p>
<p>The gambling age in California is one of the lowest in the United States. Only two states have a lower minimum age - Nebraska and Arizona, which both have a minimum age of 17. Most states have a minimum age of 21.</p>
<p>Some people argue that the minimum age should be raised to 21, as this would help protect citizens from the potential harms of gambling. However, others argue that 18 is an appropriate age, as it allows young adults to participate in legal gambling activities under supervision.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it is up to the individual states to decide what their minimum gambling age should be.</p>
<h1 id="You-Must-be-21-to-Gamble-in-California"><a href="#You-Must-be-21-to-Gamble-in-California" class="headerlink" title="You Must be 21 to Gamble in California"></a>You Must be 21 to Gamble in California</h1><p>As of January 1, 2019, in order to gamble in the state of California you must be 21 years of age or older. This new law was enacted as a result of Proposition 6, also known as the “Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Act”. The proposition was passed by California voters in November 2018 with 58% of the vote.</p>
<p>The act amends the state constitution to prohibit California from allowing betting on any type of race, including horse races, dog races, and auto races. In addition, the amendment bans all forms of gambling at casinos, card clubs, and racetracks. It does allow for raffles and “participation fee” bingo games to continue to be held at nonprofits such as churches and schools.</p>
<p>Supporters of the proposition say that it will help create safe neighborhoods and schools by reducing crime associated with gambling. They also argue that it is important to protect children from being exposed to gambling at an early age.</p>
<p>Opponents of the proposition say that it will result in job losses across the state and reduce tax revenue that is used to fund public programs. They also argue that adults should be able to make their own decision about whether or not to gamble.</p>
<p>The new law goes into effect on January 1, 2019.</p>
<h1 id="California-Picks-21-as-Gambling-Age"><a href="#California-Picks-21-as-Gambling-Age" class="headerlink" title="California Picks 21 as Gambling Age"></a>California Picks 21 as Gambling Age</h1><p>Californians voted on Tuesday to keep the legal gambling age at 21. Proposition 21, which required a majority vote to pass, would have allowed people 18 and over to gamble in casinos, play the lottery, and bet on horse races.</p>
<p>The measure’s defeat means that California will remain one of six states with a legal gambling age of 21. The other states are Alabama, Nebraska, Utah, Nevada, and Hawaii.</p>
<p>Supporters of Proposition 21 said that it would generate $1 billion in new tax revenue annually. But opponents argued that the measure would lead to more compulsive gambling and social problems.</p>
<p>Even if the proposition had passed, there was no guarantee that any new casinos or race tracks would have been built in California. The state’s gaming industry is currently in decline, with most of the casinos located in Indian reservations.</p>
<h1 id="California-sticking-with-21-as-gambling-age"><a href="#California-sticking-with-21-as-gambling-age" class="headerlink" title="California sticking with 21 as gambling age"></a>California sticking with 21 as gambling age</h1><p>After months of debating the issue, lawmakers in California have come to a consensus that they will not be raising the gambling age from 21. Gambling has been a part of California’s culture for many years, and lawmakers feel that it is important to keep the legal gambling age at 21 in order to protect consumer safety.</p>
<p>Some people argue that the legal gambling age should be raised to protect young people from developing gambling addictions at an early age. However, many lawmakers feel that it is more important to educate young people about the risks of gambling and provide resources for those who may have developed a gambling addiction.</p>
<p>In addition to protecting consumer safety, keeping the legal gambling age at 21 also helps to generate revenue for the state government. Taxes on gambling generate millions of dollars each year, which helps to fund important programs and services.</p>
<p>Ultimately, lawmakers in California feel that there are benefits to keeping the legal gambling age at 21. They will continue to work hard to make sure that consumers are protected and that revenue is generated for the state government.</p>
<h1 id="California-extends-gambling-age-to-21"><a href="#California-extends-gambling-age-to-21" class="headerlink" title="California extends gambling age to 21"></a>California extends gambling age to 21</h1><p>The state of California has voted to extend the legal gambling age from 18 to 21. The new law, which was passed on September 4th and will come into effect on January 1st, 2019, will apply to all forms of gambling, including casino games, lottery tickets, and sports betting.</p>
<p>Supporters of the bill argued that it would help protect young people from the dangers of gambling addiction, while opponents claimed that it would result in lost tax revenue for the state. Governor Jerry Brown has not yet indicated whether he will sign the bill into law.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that California has raised the gambling age; in 1984, the legal age was increased from 21 to 18. However, this is the first time that it has been raised across all forms of gambling.</p>
<p>The move comes as a number of other states are also considering increasing their gambling ages. In Nevada, for example, there is growing pressure to raise the legal age from 21 to 25.</p>
<p>Some experts believe that raising the gambling age could help reduce rates of problem gambling. According to a study by the University of Michigan’s Institute for Social Research, problem gambling rates are twice as high among 18-21 year olds than among those aged 22 or older.</p>
<p>Others argue that young people will simply find ways to gamble illegally if the legal age is raised. A report by Global Betting and Gaming Consultants (GBGC) found that more than a third of British teenagers had gambled illegally in 2016.</p>
