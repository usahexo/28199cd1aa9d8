        <h1 id="Nevada-Regulators-Approve-Sports-Betting-On-Treasure-Temple-Games"><a href="#Nevada-Regulators-Approve-Sports-Betting-On-Treasure-Temple-Games" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Regulators Approve Sports Betting On Treasure Temple Games"></a>Nevada Regulators Approve Sports Betting On Treasure Temple Games</h1><p>Nevada gaming regulators have approved a new type of sports betting that will allow gamblers to bet on so-called Treasure Temple games.</p>
<p>Treasure Temple games are a new kind of casino game that involve players trying to find treasure hidden inside simulated pyramids. The games are currently being offered at the Treasure Island casino in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>The new sports betting approval allows casinos in Nevada to take bets on the outcome of Treasure Temple games, including both which team will win and how much treasure will be found.</p>
<p>Regulators say that they approved the new type of sports betting because it does not involve traditional sporting events. They also say that the Treasure Temple games are sufficiently different from other casino games that they can be considered a separate category for sports betting purposes.</p>
<p>The approval was given despite objections from some smaller casinos that argued that the Treasure Temple games are too similar to other casino games and do not warrant their own category for sports betting.</p>
<h1 id="Utah-AG-Prohibits-Treasure-Temple-Sports-Gambling-While-State-Considers"><a href="#Utah-AG-Prohibits-Treasure-Temple-Sports-Gambling-While-State-Considers" class="headerlink" title="Utah AG Prohibits Treasure Temple Sports Gambling, While State Considers"></a>Utah AG Prohibits Treasure Temple Sports Gambling, While State Considers</h1><p>Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes has announced that the state will prohibit all forms of sports gambling, including in the proposed Treasure Temple Resort and Casino. The announcement comes as the state legislature is considering a measure that would allow sports betting in the state.</p>
<p>Reyes argued that allowing gambling at the Treasure Temple Resort and Casino would send the wrong message to Utah’s children and could lead to addiction and other social problems. “My responsibility as Attorney General is to protect our citizens, particularly our children, from the potential harms of gambling,” Reyes said in a statement. “Allowing sports gambling at the Treasure Temple Resort and Casino would be inconsistent with that responsibility.”</p>
<p>The state legislature is currently considering a measure that would allow sports betting in the state, but only at certain locations. The bill is controversial, with some lawmakers arguing that it does not go far enough to protect consumers, while others argue that it goes too far.</p>
<p>Supporters of the measure argue that it would provide new revenue for the state and would create jobs. They also argue that it would protect consumers by ensuring that bettors have access to information about the odds on different games.</p>
<p>Opponents of the measure argue that it could lead to addiction and other social problems. They also argue that it would not provide enough revenue for the state and would not create many jobs.</p>
<h1 id="Delaware-Moves-Forward-With-Plans-To-Offer-Treasure-Temple-Sports-Gambling"><a href="#Delaware-Moves-Forward-With-Plans-To-Offer-Treasure-Temple-Sports-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Delaware Moves Forward With Plans To Offer Treasure Temple Sports Gambling"></a>Delaware Moves Forward With Plans To Offer Treasure Temple Sports Gambling</h1><p>One of the smallest states in the US, Delaware is moving forward with a new gambling venture that may turn out to be a goldmine. The state has announced plans to offer Treasure Temple sports gambling, a new type of online sports betting that could bring in millions in revenue each year.</p>
<p>Treasure Temple is an innovative new game that offers players the chance to bet on Treasure Temple–a virtual world filled with glittering treasure and magical creatures. Players can bet on who will win each match in the treasure temple, and can earn huge payouts if they guess correctly.</p>
<p>The Delaware Lottery is expecting big things from Treasure Temple sports gambling. Officials say that the game has already generated a great deal of interest among casino players, and they believe it has the potential to be one of the most popular online games in the US.</p>
<p>Delaware has been struggling economically in recent years, and officials are hopeful that Treasure Temple will help to turn things around. The state has already approved plans for two new casinos, and hopes that gambling revenues will help to fund important social programs such as education and healthcare.</p>
<p>There has been some opposition to the new casinos, with some people arguing that they will ruin the small-town charm of Delaware. However, officials believe that the benefits of bringing in more revenue outweigh any potential drawbacks.</p>
<h1 id="Oregon-Legislators-Look-To-Bring-In-Treasure-Temple-Sports-Betting"><a href="#Oregon-Legislators-Look-To-Bring-In-Treasure-Temple-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Oregon Legislators Look To Bring In Treasure Temple Sports Betting"></a>Oregon Legislators Look To Bring In Treasure Temple Sports Betting</h1><p>Oregon legislators are currently looking at a proposal that would bring in Treasure Temple, a new sports betting app, to the state. The proposed legislation was submitted by the Senate President Peter Courtney and it’s currently under review.</p>
<p>What makes this proposal different from other proposals that have been submitted in the past is that it would allow Oregonians to place bets on sporting events through their smartphones. This would include bets on professional and collegiate sporting events.</p>
<p>If this proposal is passed, it would be legal for Oregonians over 21 years of age to place bets on sporting events through the Treasure Temple app. The app is currently available in Nevada and Delaware and it allows users to place bets on a variety of sporting events, including football, basketball, hockey, and baseball.</p>
<p>The proposal has been met with some opposition, but supporters feel that it could help generate additional revenue for the state. Courtney believes that the proposal could generate as much as $10 million in revenue for the state each year.</p>
<p>Treasure Temple has already agreed to pay the state a percentage of its profits if the proposal is passed. The company has also agreed to donate $100,000 per year to promote responsible gaming habits among Oregonians.</p>
<p>Those in favor of the proposal believe that it will help create jobs and stimulate the economy. They also feel that it will provide additional revenue for education and other important programs in Oregon.</p>
<h1 id="New-Jersey-Poised-To-Allow-Treasure-Temple-Sports-Betting-In-Casinos"><a href="#New-Jersey-Poised-To-Allow-Treasure-Temple-Sports-Betting-In-Casinos" class="headerlink" title="New Jersey Poised To Allow Treasure Temple Sports Betting In Casinos"></a>New Jersey Poised To Allow Treasure Temple Sports Betting In Casinos</h1><p>In a move that could open the floodgates for legalized sports betting in the United States, the New Jersey state legislature has passed a bill that would allow casinos in the state to offer sports betting. The bill now goes to Governor Phil Murphy, who is expected to sign it into law.</p>
<p>New Jersey has been trying to legalize sports betting for years, with two unsuccessful attempts in federal court. However, the Supreme Court overturned a federal ban on sports betting last year, clearing the way for states to legalize it.</p>
<p>Since then, several states have moved to legalize sports betting, including Delaware, Mississippi, New York, and Pennsylvania. West Virginia became the first state to begin taking bets last week.</p>
<p>Supporters of legalized sports betting say it will generate much-needed revenue for state governments. They also argue that it will help keep people from betting illegally and that it will create jobs in the gambling industry.</p>
<p>Opponents of legalized sports betting say it will lead to more gambling addiction and other social problems. They also argue that it will hurt the traditional sports leagues, which rely on fans not placing bets on games.</p>
<p>The New Jersey bill allows casinos in Atlantic City and other parts of the state to offer most types of sports betting, including wagers on professional and college games. It does not allow online or mobile betting, however.</p>
<p>Governor Phil Murphy is expected to sign the bill into law within days.</p>

        <h1 id="Gambling-Losses-Can-be-Deducted-from-Your-Taxes"><a href="#Gambling-Losses-Can-be-Deducted-from-Your-Taxes" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Losses Can be Deducted from Your Taxes"></a>Gambling Losses Can be Deducted from Your Taxes</h1><p>Gambling losses are tax deductible in the United States. This is true whether you gamble at a casino, make bets with friends, or play the lottery. Your gambling losses can offset your gambling winnings, reducing your taxable income.</p>
<p>In order to deduct your gambling losses, you must itemize your deductions on Schedule A of Form 1040. This means that you cannot take the standard deduction and also claim gambling losses. You must choose between the standard deduction or itemized deductions, and cannot claim both.</p>
<p>Your gambling losses are only deductible up to the amount of your gambling winnings. If you have $2,000 in winnings and $4,000 in losses, you can only deduct $2,000 of your losses. Any excess loss cannot be deducted and is simply written off as a net loss for the year.</p>
<p>There are some restrictions on who can claim gambling losses. You can only deduct losses if you incurred them in a “gambling business.” This includes activities such as making wagers or playing games of chance for money or something else of value. Casual gambling where you bet on various things such as sporting events or horse races does not count as a business and therefore your losses cannot be deducted.</p>
<p>There is one other caveat to claiming gambling losses: they must be legitimate! The IRS does not look kindly on taxpayers who try to write off their personal expenses as business expenses. If the IRS finds that you are trying to improperly deduct your personal expenses, they could disallow all of your deductions, including your gambling losses.</p>
<p>Despite these restrictions, gambling losses provide a valuable tax deduction for those who incur them. If you are a regular gambler, be sure to keep track of your winnings and losses so that you can accurately report them on your tax return.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-Losses-Can-be-Written-Off-on-Your-Taxes"><a href="#Gambling-Losses-Can-be-Written-Off-on-Your-Taxes" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Losses Can be Written Off on Your Taxes"></a>Gambling Losses Can be Written Off on Your Taxes</h1><p>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) allows taxpayers to write-off gambling losses on their tax return. This includes casino games, horse and dog racing, and state lottery tickets. However, there are some rules and restrictions that you must follow in order to qualify for the tax deduction.</p>
<p>Gambling losses can be deducted as an itemized deduction on your federal tax return. This means that you can only deduct your losses if you also claim other itemized deductions on your return. You cannot claim a gambling loss deduction if you take the standard deduction instead of itemizing.</p>
<p>In order to claim a gambling loss deduction, you must have documentation to support your losses. This includes receipts from the casinos or racetracks, tickets for lottery games, and cancelled checks or credit card statements showing the amount of your bets. You must also have records of any winnings that you reported on your taxes.</p>
<p>The amount of gambling losses that you can deduct is limited to the amount of gambling income that you report on your tax return. For example, if you had $1,000 in gambling income and $2,000 in losses, you can only deduct $1,000 on your taxes. If you have no gambling income, you cannot deduct any losses.</p>
<p>There are a few other restrictions on gambling loss deductions:</p>
<p>-You cannot claim a loss for betting on horses or dogs if the race is not held in the United States or Canada.</p>
<p>-You cannot claim a loss for playing poker or other casino games unless the game is considered to be a “hobby.” To qualify as a hobby, you must report the activity on Schedule C and show that it is not engaged in for profit.</p>
<h1 id="You-Can-Take-a-Tax-Deduction-for-Gambling-Losses"><a href="#You-Can-Take-a-Tax-Deduction-for-Gambling-Losses" class="headerlink" title="You Can Take a Tax Deduction for Gambling Losses"></a>You Can Take a Tax Deduction for Gambling Losses</h1><p>In the United States, you’re allowed to take a deduction for gambling losses if you itemize your deductions. This means that you can deduct any money you lose while gambling from your taxable income. However, there are a few things you need to know about claiming a deduction for gambling losses:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>You can only claim a deduction for gambling losses if you have gambling winnings too.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You can only claim a deduction for losses up to the amount of your winnings.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You must keep track of your winnings and losses throughout the year.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Gambling losses are not deductible if you are considered a professional gambler.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you meet all of the conditions listed above, you can write off your gambling losses on your tax return. This can help reduce the amount of taxable income you have, which can lead to lower taxes owed. Keep in mind that this is just one of many deductions available to taxpayers, so be sure to consult with a tax professional to see if it’s right for you.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Claim-a-Gambling-Loss-on-Your-Taxes"><a href="#How-to-Claim-a-Gambling-Loss-on-Your-Taxes" class="headerlink" title="How to Claim a Gambling Loss on Your Taxes"></a>How to Claim a Gambling Loss on Your Taxes</h1><p>If you gamble and lose money, you can claim some of that loss on your taxes. This can help reduce the amount of taxable income you have and may save you some money on your taxes.</p>
<p>To claim a gambling loss on your taxes, you’ll need to report the amount of your losses to the IRS. You can do this on Schedule A, which is used to report itemized deductions. This includes things like mortgage interest, charitable donations, and gambling losses.</p>
<p>In order to claim your gambling losses on Schedule A, you’ll need to meet two requirements. First, you’ll need to have itemized deductions that are greater than the standard deduction for your tax filing status. Second, your gambling losses must be more than your gambling winnings.</p>
<p>If both of these requirements are met, you can deduct your gambling losses as a miscellaneous deduction on Schedule A. This deduction is subject to a 2% floor, which means that only the first $2,500 of your miscellaneous deductions will be deductible.</p>
<p> reporting Gambling Losses on las Vegas slot machines</p>
<p>  While most people think about winning when they go to Las Vegas or any other casino destination, it’s important to also be aware of what happens when you lose. In fact, if you’re smart about it, reporting gambling losses can help reduce your tax liability at the end of the year.  So how does it work? </p>
<p>First of all, in order to claim a gambling loss on your taxes ,you’ll need to report the amount of your losses to the IRS . You can do this on Schedule A , which is used</p>
<h1 id="IRS-Allows-Taxpayers-to-Deduct-Gambling-Losses"><a href="#IRS-Allows-Taxpayers-to-Deduct-Gambling-Losses" class="headerlink" title="IRS Allows Taxpayers to Deduct Gambling Losses"></a>IRS Allows Taxpayers to Deduct Gambling Losses</h1><p>The Internal Revenue Service announced that taxpayers can deduct their gambling losses on their federal income taxes. The new rules went into effect on January 1, 2019.</p>
<p>“This is great news for taxpayers who enjoy gambling,” said IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig in a statement. “Our goal is to provide taxpayers with clear and concise information about their tax obligations and rights.”</p>
<p>Under the new rules, taxpayers can deduct any losses they incurred during the year, as long as they itemize deductions on their tax return. The amount of the deduction will be based on the amount of gambling income the taxpayer reported on their return.</p>
<p>The IRS also issued guidance for casinos and other gaming establishments. Casino operators must now report winnings and losses to the IRS on Form W-2G, which will help the IRS track gambling activity.</p>
<p>The new rules are good news for taxpayers who enjoy gambling, but they may also have implications for online casinos. It’s not yet clear how the new rules will be enforced online, but it’s likely that casino operators will be required to report winnings and losses to the IRS in the same way that land-based casinos are.</p>

        <h1 id="Couple-Wins-Big-Pays-Big-Taxes"><a href="#Couple-Wins-Big-Pays-Big-Taxes" class="headerlink" title="Couple Wins Big, Pays Big Taxes"></a>Couple Wins Big, Pays Big Taxes</h1><p>It was a big year for the Smiths – they both won the lottery and got married. But there was one catch – the winnings were taxable.</p>
<p>The Smiths were faced with a daunting decision – should they spend their money on a new home, cars, vacations, or pay the taxes? They ultimately decided to pay the taxes and enjoy their new lives together.</p>
<p>“We didn’t want to have any regrets,” said Mrs. Smith. “We knew that we could always enjoy our money later, but we only get one chance at this life together.”</p>
<p>The Smiths aren’t the only ones who have had to make this tough decision – thousands of other Americans face the same dilemma every year. Some choose to spend their money and deal with the taxes later, while others choose to pay the taxes upfront and avoid any potential headaches down the road.</p>
<p>No matter what choice you make, it’s important to be aware of the tax implications involved. So if you hit the jackpot this year, consult with an accountant or financial advisor to figure out what’s best for you.</p>
<h1 id="Taxes-Cut-for-Low-Income-Earners-but-Not-for-Winners"><a href="#Taxes-Cut-for-Low-Income-Earners-but-Not-for-Winners" class="headerlink" title="Taxes Cut for Low-Income Earners but Not for Winners"></a>Taxes Cut for Low-Income Earners but Not for Winners</h1><p>Republicans in the House and Senate passed a bill to overhaul the American tax system. The proposal would cut taxes for low-income earners but not for the wealthy.</p>
<p>The bill would reduce the number of tax brackets from seven to four, with rates of 12 percent, 25 percent, 35 percent, and 39.6 percent. The bill also doubles the standard deduction while eliminating most itemized deductions.</p>
<p>The bill would eliminate the state and local tax deduction and the alternative minimum tax. The estate tax would be eliminated after six years.</p>
<p>The child tax credit would be increased from $1,000 to $2,000, and the eligibility age would be reduced from 17 to 16. The bill also creates a new $300 credit for adults aged 65 and older.</p>
<p>The legislation was passed by a vote of 227 to 205 in the House and 51 to 49 in the Senate. No Democrats voted for the measure in either chamber. Thirteen Republicans voted against the bill in the House, while one Republican opposed it in the Senate.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump is expected to sign the bill into law before Christmas.</p>
<h1 id="Winners-Pay-More-Than-30-in-Taxes"><a href="#Winners-Pay-More-Than-30-in-Taxes" class="headerlink" title="Winners Pay More Than 30% in Taxes"></a>Winners Pay More Than 30% in Taxes</h1><p>The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 reduced the federal income tax rates for individuals across the board. However, as a recent study shows, some taxpayers are still paying more than 30% in taxes.</p>
<p>The study, conducted by the government watchdog group Public Citizen, found that the highest-earning 1% of taxpayers paid an average federal income tax rate of 33.4% in 2018. This is more than three times the rate paid by the lowest-earning 60% of taxpayers, who had an average tax rate of 10.2%.</p>
<p>Interestingly, despite the lower rates in the TCJA, the average federal income tax rate for the top 1% actually increased from 32.5% in 2017. This is likely due to the elimination of many deductions and exemptions under the new law.</p>
<p>One reason for this discrepancy is that the TCJA doubled the standard deduction and eliminated many itemized deductions. As a result, only a small percentage of taxpayers are now itemizing their deductions, which tended to benefit higher earners more than others.</p>
<p>There are also significant differences in federal income tax rates across states. The highest-earning 1% of taxpayers paid an average state income tax rate of 5.8% in 2018, while the lowest-earning 60% of taxpayers paid an average state income tax rate of 2%.</p>
<p>This disparity is even more pronounced when comparing individual states. For example, while New York has some of the highest federal and state income tax rates in the country, Louisiana has some of the lowest.</p>
<p>So what can be done to reduce this unfairness? One possible solution is to repeal or reduce state and local taxes (SALT), which disproportionately affect high-income taxpayers. Another option is to expand or create new deductions and credits that would benefit low- and middle-income earners.</p>
<p>Whatever solution lawmakers choose, it’s clear that the current tax system is unfair and needs reform.</p>
<h1 id="How-Much-Taxes-Do-You-Pay-on-Your-Winnings"><a href="#How-Much-Taxes-Do-You-Pay-on-Your-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="How Much Taxes Do You Pay on Your Winnings?"></a>How Much Taxes Do You Pay on Your Winnings?</h1><p>Americans love to gamble. Whether it’s at the casino, the dog track, or the lottery, we just can’t seem to help ourselves. And while gambling is certainly risky, it can also be lucrative. But just how much of your winnings are Uncle Sam going to take?</p>
<p>The answer, unfortunately, is that it depends. Different types of gambling incur different tax rates, and your state may also have its own taxes on gambling income. Here is a general overview of the taxation of gambling income in the United States:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Gambling income from traditional casino games such as blackjack or roulette is subject to ordinary income tax rates.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Winnings from state lotteries are taxed as ordinary income.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Winnings from online lotteries are taxed as ordinary income.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Winnings from casino games played online are subject to the same ordinary income tax rates as traditional casino games.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Winnings from horse race betting are subject to a special wage withholding tax of 25%. However, if you file Form W-2G with your federal return and report your winnings as Other Gambling Income, no further tax is due.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Winnings from fantasy sports leagues are considered taxable income. The Internal Revenue Service has not issued specific guidance on how these winnings should be taxed, but most likely they would be taxed at the same rate as other gambling income.</p>

A couple who had been married for 42 years won a $259 million jackpot in the state lottery, but they may now have to give up a large chunk of that prize to the Internal Revenue Service.</p>
<p>The couple, who have asked to remain anonymous, say they plan to use their winnings to help their children and grandchildren. But according to tax experts, the IRS will likely want approximately half of the winnings as taxes. That would leave the couple with just over $130 million after taxes.</p>
<p>While it’s certainly nothing to sneeze at, it’s a far cry from the windfall they were hoping for. And it’s sure to leave them feeling a bit poorer than they did before their big win.</p>
<p>The good news is that there are ways to minimize the amount of taxes you have to pay on your lottery winnings. One option is to take the lump sum payment instead of opting for annual payments over several years. This will allow you to take advantage of tax deductions and credits that are available only if you take the lump sum.</p>
<p>You can also consult with a tax professional to see if there are any other strategies that can help reduce your tax bill. Whatever route you choose, it’s important to understand exactly what you’re liable for when it comes to taxes and lottery winnings.</p>
<p>So if you happen to hit the jackpot soon, be sure to consult with an expert before claiming your prize!</p>

        <h1 id="Why-is-the-Pioneer-Internet-Casino-Closed"><a href="#Why-is-the-Pioneer-Internet-Casino-Closed" class="headerlink" title="Why is the Pioneer Internet Casino Closed?"></a>Why is the Pioneer Internet Casino Closed?</h1><p>On 02&#x2F;13&#x2F;2018, the Pioneer Internet Casino announced that it was closed effective immediately. The closure left many questions unanswered, including why the casino closed and what would happen to player funds.</p>
<p>The Pioneer Casino has been in business since 2001 and is one of the longest-running online casinos. It offers games from several software providers, including NetEnt, Microgaming, and Play’n GO. It has a reputation for being a reputable and safe casino with a wide selection of games.</p>
<p>So why did it close? There has been no official explanation from the casino or its operators. However, there are several theories about why it might have closed:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The casino may have been shut down as part of an investigation into illegal gambling operations. This is the most likely explanation, as several other online casinos have been shut down in recent months as part of a crackdown by the Malaysian government.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The casino may have been forced to close due to financial difficulties. This is also possible, as the online gambling industry has been struggling in recent years. In 2017, the global online gambling market was worth $49.3 billion, but this is projected to decline to $45.8 billion by 2021.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The casino may have closed in order to rebrand or relaunch under a new name. This is also possible, but there is no evidence to support this theory.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Whatever the reason for the closure, players are understandably concerned about what will happen to their funds. The casino has not yet clarified what will happen to player funds or whether they will be refunded. However, we can hope that players will be able to get their money back eventually.</p>
<h1 id="Pioneer-Internet-Casino-Closes-Its-Doors"><a href="#Pioneer-Internet-Casino-Closes-Its-Doors" class="headerlink" title="Pioneer Internet Casino Closes Its Doors"></a>Pioneer Internet Casino Closes Its Doors</h1><p>The Pioneer Internet Casino, the first online gambling site to open its doors, has announced that it is closing down.</p>
<p>The news comes as a surprise to many, as the casino has been one of the most popular online gambling destinations for years.</p>
<p>In a statement released on the casino’s website, management cited increased regulation and compliance costs as the main reason for the closure.</p>
<p>“It is with great regret that we announce the closure of Pioneer Internet Casino,” reads the statement. “The increasing cost of compliance and regulation has made it impossible for us to continue offering our services.”</p>
<p>The Pioneer Internet Casino was founded in 1998, making it one of the oldest online casinos in operation. It was among the first sites to offer real-money gambling games such as blackjack, poker and slots.</p>
<p>In recent years, however, the casino has come under pressure from regulators who have pushed for increased transparency and compliance with KYC and AML regulations. This has resulted in increased costs for the casino, which has been unable to pass on these costs to its customers.</p>
<p>“The closure of Pioneer Internet Casino is a sad day for online gambling,” said an industry commentator. “This site was instrumental in the growth of online gambling and helped lay the foundation for what has become a multi-billion dollar industry.”</p>
<h1 id="Pioneer-Internet-Casino-Closing-Its-Doors"><a href="#Pioneer-Internet-Casino-Closing-Its-Doors" class="headerlink" title="Pioneer Internet Casino Closing Its Doors"></a>Pioneer Internet Casino Closing Its Doors</h1><p>After 21 years of operation, Pioneer Internet Casino is closing its doors. The casino, which was one of the first in the world to offer online gambling, has announced that it will cease operations on March 31st, 2019.</p>
<p>In a statement released on the casino’s website, management said that the decision to close was made after a “careful and extensive evaluation of the market and our business.” The statement went on to say that “the competitive landscape has shifted dramatically in recent years” and that the casino is no longer able to operate profitably.</p>
<p>Pioneer Internet Casino opened its doors in 1998, long before online casinos became popular. At the time, it was one of only a handful of casinos offering games over the internet. In its early years, Pioneer was extremely successful, attracting players from all over the world.</p>
<p>However, in recent years the casino has fallen behind its competitors. A number of new operators have entered the market, offering more games and bigger jackpots. Pioneer has also been hurt by increasing regulation and government crackdowns on online gambling.</p>
<p>Despite efforts to revive its fortunes, Pioneer Internet Casino has decided to call it quits. Players who have funds remaining in their accounts are being advised to contact customer service for information on how to withdraw their money.</p>
<h1 id="Why-Did-Pioneer-Internet-Casino-Close"><a href="#Why-Did-Pioneer-Internet-Casino-Close" class="headerlink" title="Why Did Pioneer Internet Casino Close?"></a>Why Did Pioneer Internet Casino Close?</h1><p>On July 2, 2018, it was announced that Pioneer Internet Casino had closed its doors. This casino was well known for being one of the first to offer online gambling to players in the United States. At the time of the closure, it was unclear why the casino had shut down.</p>
<p>However, on July 13th, 2018, an article in The Las Vegas Review-Journal provided some answers. According to the article, the closure was due to financial difficulties that the company was experiencing. Specifically, the article stated that Pioneer had been struggling to repay a $4 million loan from a group of investors.</p>
<p>In addition to its financial troubles, Pioneer also faced some legal challenges. For example, in 2017 the state of Kentucky sued Pioneer for offering gambling services to its residents without having obtained a license from the state.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, Pioneer had been operating since 1998 and had become one of the most well-known and trusted brands in the industry. Unfortunately, its financial troubles led to its closure earlier this year.</p>
<h1 id="What-Caused-Pioneer-Internet-Casino-to-Close"><a href="#What-Caused-Pioneer-Internet-Casino-to-Close" class="headerlink" title="What Caused Pioneer Internet Casino to Close?"></a>What Caused Pioneer Internet Casino to Close?</h1><p>In March of 2019, Pioneer Internet Casino (PIC) abruptly announced that it was shutting down and would be ceasing operations. This left players with a lot of questions about what had happened and what they could do to get their money back.</p>
<p>To date, there has not been a definitive answer as to why PIC closed its doors. However, there are a few possible explanations that have been put forth. One possibility is that the casino was experiencing financial difficulties and was unable to continue operating. Another possibility is that the casino was shut down by law enforcement for illegal activities.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason for PIC’s closure, players are still owed money and need to take action to try and get it back. There are a few steps that players can take in order to try and recover their funds.</p>
<p>The first step is to reach out to PIC and try to get in touch with someone who can help. The casino may have an online support system or email address where players can contact them. If the casino does not have an online presence anymore, then players can search for archived websites or social media accounts where information may be stored.</p>
<p>Once players have contacted PIC, they should provide as much information as possible about their account, including: name, address, username, password, last four digits of their social security number, and dates of deposit and withdrawal. This information will help PIC determine if players are eligible for a refund.</p>
<p>If players cannot reach PIC or if the casino does not respond, then they can file a complaint with the appropriate government agency. In the US, this would be the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The FTC will investigate the situation and may be able to help players get their money back.</p>
<p>Pioneer Internet Casino was a popular online gambling destination for many players until it abruptly shut down in 2019. While the reason for the closure is still unknown, there are steps that players can take to try and get their money back. Players should first reach out to PIC and provide as much information as possible about their account. If they are unsuccessful in reaching PIC or getting any response from the casino, then they can file a complaint with the FTC.</p>

<p>The average salary for casino hosts in the United States is $40,000 per year. The commission they make depends on the casino, but it can be as much as 25% of what a patron spends. </p>
<p>Therefore, the average casino host makes an annual salary of $50,000 plus commission.</p>
<h1 id="Are-Casino-Hosts-Making-a-Lot-of-Money"><a href="#Are-Casino-Hosts-Making-a-Lot-of-Money" class="headerlink" title="Are Casino Hosts Making a Lot of Money?"></a>Are Casino Hosts Making a Lot of Money?</h1><p>Most casino hosts are making a lot of money, according to recent surveys. In a survey of over 2,000 casino hosts, 80% reported that they made more than $75,000 in 2016. That’s a pretty good salary, especially considering that the position only requires a high school diploma or equivalent.</p>
<p>The fact that casino hosts are making so much money is likely due to the increasing demand for their services. As casinos get bigger and more popular, the need for knowledgeable and friendly hosts grows as well. Hosts are responsible for greeting guests, helping them find the right game and providing any other assistance they may need. They also play an important role in customer retention, which is why casinos are happy to pay them well.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in becoming a casino host, there are a few things you should know first. For one thing, you’ll need to have strong customer service skills and be able to build relationships with guests quickly. You should also be familiar with casino games and rules, as well as casino policies and procedures.</p>
<p>In addition to having impressive skills, it’s also important to look the part. Most casinos prefer their hosts to dress professionally and look neat and tidy at all times. So if you’re not exactly comfortable wearing a suit or dress every day, this may not be the right job for you.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that being a casino host can be demanding, it’s also a very rewarding career. If you’re looking for a job that pays well and allows you to meet new people every day, then this could be the perfect opportunity for you.</p>

They work with guests to find out their interests and help them find the best games and promotions to enjoy while they are at the casino. Casino hosts make an annual salary that ranges from $23,000 to $47,000. </p>
<p>The average wage for a casino host is $32,000 per year. This wage can range from $23,000 to $47,000 per year depending on the level of experience that the host has. Most casino hosts start off making around $23,000 per year and can make up to $47,000 after they have been working as a host for a few years. </p>
<p>Most casino hosts work full-time hours; however, there are some hosts who work part-time hours. The hours that a host works will vary depending on their employer and their availability. Some casino hosts may only work during weekends or holiday periods. </p>
<p>Casino hosts are responsible for greeting guests who enter the casino, helping them find the games and promotions that they are interested in, and answering any questions that they may have about the casino. Hosts also provide information about what is happening in the casino at any given time and offer suggestions about which games to play. </p>
<p>In order to become a casino host, an individual must typically have some customer service experience. Many casinos prefer to hire those who have worked in the hospitality industry before. It is also important that a casino host be able to multitask and be organized as there may be several guests that they are working with at once. </p>
<p>Hosts typically receive benefits such as medical insurance, dental insurance, 401k plans, and paid time off. They may also receive free or discounted meals while they are working at the casino. </p>
<p>The job of a casino host is important because they help create a positive experience for guests who visit the casino. They make sure that guests enjoy their time at the casino and find what they are looking for while they are there. This can result in guests returning to the casino in the future and potentially spending more money there.</p>
<h1 id="What-Is-the-Average-Salary-for-a-Casino-Host"><a href="#What-Is-the-Average-Salary-for-a-Casino-Host" class="headerlink" title="What Is the Average Salary for a Casino Host?"></a>What Is the Average Salary for a Casino Host?</h1><p>Casino hosts are responsible for greeting guests, providing information about the casino and its amenities, and helping to ensure that guests have a good experience. They may also be responsible for issuing gaming cards and monitoring activity on the casino floor.</p>
<p>The average salary for a casino host is $31,700 per year, according to Simply Hired. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reports that the median wage for this occupation was $23,780 in 2016.</p>
<p>The BLS projects that employment for casino hosts will grow by 10 percent from 2016 to 2026, faster than the average for all occupations. As gambling expands into new markets, more casinos will be needed, and this will create opportunities for casino hosts. </p>
<p>Those with experience in customer service or hospitality may have an advantage when seeking a job as a casino host. Some casinos also require hosts to be able to speak multiple languages. </p>
<p>It is important to remember that wages can vary depending on the city or state in which a casino is located. For example, Simply Hired reports that the average salary for a casino host in Las Vegas is $40,000 per year, while the average salary for a casino host in Reno is just $24,000 per year.</p>
<h1 id="How-Much-Money-Do-Casino-Hosts-Make-a-Year"><a href="#How-Much-Money-Do-Casino-Hosts-Make-a-Year" class="headerlink" title="How Much Money Do Casino Hosts Make a Year?"></a>How Much Money Do Casino Hosts Make a Year?</h1><p>Casino hosts can make a lot of money, but their income varies depending on the casino, their position within the casino, and the number of hours they work. Some casino hosts can earn a six-figure salary, while others may only earn a few thousand dollars a year.</p>
<p>The average annual salary for casino hosts in the United States is about $40,000, but this figure varies depending on the state. In California, for example, casino hosts make an average of $60,000 a year, while in New York they earn an average of $30,000. Casino hosts in other states earn salaries that fall somewhere in between these two figures.</p>
<p>The amount of money that casino hosts make also depends on their position within the casino. Hosts who work for table games or slots dealers may earn less than those who work in administrative or executive positions. Hosts who work long hours may also make more money than those who do not.</p>
<p>So, how much money can you expect to make as a casino host? While there is no one answer to this question, most casino hosts make between $25,000 and $75,000 per year.</p>

The game has been around since the late 18th century, and its popularity means there are now all sorts of variations of the game available. If you’re looking to try your luck at roulette in Schaumburg’s Middle Ages Times Casino, here’s what you need to know:</p>
<p>The Basics</p>
<p>Roulette is a simple game to play. You place your bets on a layout that features a number of different betting options, with each bet having a different payout. A ball is then spun around a wheel that has 37 (in French roulette) or 38 (in American roulette) slots - one of which is black, and the other red. As the ball slows down, it will eventually fall into one of the slots and this will determine the winner of the bet.</p>
<p>There are numerous bets you can make on roulette, but some of the most common ones are betting on a single number (which pays out 35-1), betting on two numbers either side of each other (which pays out 17-1), betting on whether the ball will land on black or red (which pays out even money), and betting on whether the ball will land on an even or odd number (which also pays out even money).</p>
<p>How To Play</p>
<p>To play roulette in Schaumburg’s Middle Ages Times Casino, first choose how much you want to bet. This can be done by clicking on one of the chips at the bottom of the screen and then selecting how many chips you want to bet. Once you’ve chosen your chip amount, hover over one of the betting options on the table and click once to place your bet. You can also press ‘SUBMIT’ to automatically bet your chosen amount on whatever option is highlighted.</p>
<p>If you want to change your bet amount or remove a bet, simply hover over it and press ‘X’. This will remove your chip from that betting option. To add more chips, hover over one of the empty spots at the bottom of the screen and select how many chips you want to bet - this will automatically place your bet for you. Remember that if you run out of chips, you can always buy more by clicking on ‘CHANGE’.</p>
<p>Once all players have placed their bets, hit ‘PLAY’ to start the game. The dealer will then spin the ball around the wheel and it will eventually fall into one of the slots. The winner is then announced and their bet amounts are paid out accordingly.</p>

If you’re looking to try your luck and maybe score some serious winnings, read on for some tips on how to do just that!</p>
<p>To begin with, always research the casino before playing there. Make sure they are reputable and have a good track record. Once you’ve found a safe and reputable casino, it’s time to choose your game. Roulette is a good choice if you’re new to gambling, because the odds are relatively simple to understand and the game moves quickly.</p>
<p>Next, learn the different types of bets available and how much they pay out. There are Inside Bets and Outside Bets available at roulette tables. The Inside Bets are easier to win but offer lower payouts, while the Outside Bets offer higher payouts but are harder to win. Some of the most common bets include betting on a single number (the Straight Up bet), betting on two adjacent numbers (the Split Bet), and betting on whether the ball will land in a red or black slot (the Red&#x2F;Black Bet).</p>
<p>Once you’ve chosen your bet, place your chips on the table in the corresponding area. Then, wait for the croupier to spin the wheel and let the ball fall into one of the slots. If your prediction is correct, congrats! You’ve won! Be sure to collect your payout from the croupier before cashing out and leaving the table.</p>
<p>If you don’t happen to win on your first try, don’t worry. Just remember that it takes some luck as well as skill to beat roulette – so keep practicing and you’ll be sure to come out ahead in no time!</p>

<p>*Start with a small bet to get a feel for the game.</p>
<p>*Watch the other players at the table and try to figure out what kind of bets they are making.</p>
<p>*Don’t bet on black or red - the chances of winning are even-money.</p>
<p>*Bet on numbers instead. The odds of winning are slightly better than betting on colors.</p>
<p>*Use outside bets whenever possible. This means betting on things like odd or even, high or low, and red or black. These bets have better odds than betting on a single number.</p>

This board game was introduced to France by the soldier of fortune named Blaise Pascal in 1655. He is also credited for being the inventor of the modern roulette wheel.</p>
<p>The name “roulette” is derived from a French word meaning little wheel. The original game consisted of a wooden wheel with 37 or 38 slots numbered 1 through 36, plus a single zero slot. Players bet on which slot the ball would come to rest in after spinning the wheel.</p>
<p>Today, Roulette is one of the most popular casino games and can be found at virtually every land-based and online casino. The game has remained largely unchanged over the years, with a few minor rule variations here and there.</p>
<p>In this article, we will take a closer look at the rules of Roulette and provide you with some tips on how to play and win at this exciting casino game.</p>
<p>How to Play Roulette</p>
<p>Roulette is a relatively easy game to play and can be enjoyed by both novice and experienced players alike. The objective of the game is to guess where the ball will land after spinning the wheel. You can place bets on a single number, a range of numbers, odd or even numbers, red or black numbers, or choose to bet on one of the two zeroes on the wheel (0 or 00).</p>
<p>To begin playing, you first need to place your bets by clicking on the desired chip value and then clicking on the betting area on the table layout. After all bets have been placed, click on ‘Spin’ to start the wheel spinning. The ball will then be released and will travel around the edge of the wheel until it comes to rest in one of the numbered slots. Your winning bet payout will be based on the odds for that particular bet type.</p>
<p>Here are some basic tips for playing Roulette:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Be aware of which bets offer good odds and which ones offer poor odds. For example, betting on black or red offers odds of 1:1, while betting on a single number offers odds of 35:1. So if you’re looking for a lower-risk option, stick to betting on colours or even&#x2F;odd numbers instead of betting on specific numbers.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Make use of outside bets whenever possible as these offer better odds than inside bets. For example, betting on red&#x2F;black, even&#x2F;odd, or 1-18&#x2F;19-36 offers odds of 1:1 compared to odds of 2:1 offered by betting on individual numbers.</p>
</li>
</ul>

The patron, a 15-year old boy, attempted to do so after he saw an older gentleman having difficulty reaching the lever.</p>
<p>According to security footage from the casino, the young boy was politely turned away by a casino employee who said that it was against policy for anyone other than the disabled person to operate the game. The boy and his mother were visiting from out of town and were only in Las Vegas for a few days.</p>
<p>The story has since gone viral, with many people criticizing the casino for their policy. Some have even called for a boycott of the establishment.Others have argued that it is reasonable for casinos to have such policies in place in order to protect the safety and well-being of their customers.</p>
<p>What do you think? Should casinos be allowed to refuse service to patrons who are not disabled? Let us know in the comments below!</p>
<h1 id="Casino-stands-up-for-disabled-man-denies-underage-patron-access-to-Cave-Raiders-HD-game"><a href="#Casino-stands-up-for-disabled-man-denies-underage-patron-access-to-Cave-Raiders-HD-game" class="headerlink" title="Casino stands up for disabled man, denies underage patron access to Cave Raiders HD game"></a>Casino stands up for disabled man, denies underage patron access to Cave Raiders HD game</h1><p>The management of a popular casino in Las Vegas is standing up for a disabled man who was allegedly denied access to a game because of his disability. The man, who has not been identified, suffers from a condition that leaves him unable to walk without assistance. When he and his caretaker attempted to play the Cave Raiders HD game at the casino, they were told by a staff member that the game was for “people who can walk.”</p>
<p>The casino’s management has issued a statement denying that any such policy exists, and has even offered the disabled man and his caretaker complimentary tickets to any game of their choice. In addition, the casino has made a donation to a charity that helps people with disabilities. This story serves as a reminder that there are still people out there who are willing to stand up for those who are marginalized and discriminated against.</p>

In a statement issued Wednesday, casino officials said they “uphold honor” by refusing to let the underage patron play.</p>
<p>The disabled man was playing the game at a kiosk in the casino when the underage patron attempted to take his place and pull the lever. Casino security personnel quickly intervened and prevented the underage patron from playing. The disabled man was able to complete his game and collect his prize.</p>
<p>In its statement, casino officials said that allowing the underage patron to play would have been “against our moral code.” They added that they are “committed to providing a safe and enjoyable experience for all of our guests.”</p>
<p>The incident has generated considerable backlash on social media, with many people accusing the casino of discrimination. Some have called for a boycott of the casino. However, others have defended the casino’s decision, saying that it was necessary to protect the disabled man.</p>
<p>What do you think? Should casinos be allowed to deny access to games based on their own moral codes? Let us know in the comments!</p>

However, when an employee saw the disabled man playing the game, they allowed him to continue playing even though he was not of legal age.</p>
<p>The disabled man was very happy that the casino put his needs first and allowed him to play the game. He said that it made him feel very special and that he really appreciated it.</p>

This decision was made based on the safety of the disabled man who was playing the game at the same time.</p>
<p>The casino had received complaints from other patrons that the disabled man’s wheelchair was taking up too much space. They were also concerned that he might not be able to safely navigate through the crowds if there was a large influx of people.</p>
<p>In light of these concerns, the casino decided to deny access to the underage patron in order to ensure the safety of all of its patrons. This decision was met with criticism from some members of the community, but ultimately, the casino put safety first.</p>
