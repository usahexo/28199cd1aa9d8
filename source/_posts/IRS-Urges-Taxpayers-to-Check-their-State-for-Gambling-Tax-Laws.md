#  IRS Urges Taxpayers to Check their State for Gambling Tax Laws

The Internal Revenue Service is urging taxpayers to check their state for gambling tax laws. The agency said that it’s possible some states don’t have a gambling tax and taxpayers might not realize they have to pay federal taxes on their gambling income.

“People need to be aware that gambling income is taxable, even if it’s from illegal activities,” said IRS spokesman Luis D. Garcia. “And if you live in a state that doesn’t have a gambling tax, you still have to pay federal taxes on your winnings.”

Garcia said the best way to find out if your state has a gambling tax is to check the website of the department of revenue or taxation in your state. He added that the IRS has a free publication, Tax Tips for Gamblers, which provides more information on how gambling income is taxed.

The Internal Revenue Service issued a warning Monday telling taxpayers to be checking their states for gambling tax laws because some states don't levy such a tax and the feds want their cut nonetheless.


"People need to be aware that gambling income is taxable, even if it's from illegal activities," said Luis D. Garcia, an IRS spokesman. Those earning such income "have to pay federal taxes on their winnings," he told the National Law Journal.


Taxpayers can check with their state's department of revenue or taxation website for information on any applicable gambling taxes owed to the respective state government. The IRS also has a free publication - Tax Tips for Gamblers - detailing these types of taxes.

#  Gambling Tax Laws Vary from State to State

Americans love gambling. The opportunity to risk money in the hopes of winning more is a temptation that’s hard for many to resist, and there are plenty of ways to do so, from the traditional casino game of craps to modern, high-tech options like online poker.

But as anyone who’s ever gambled knows, there’s a price to pay for all that fun: taxes.

Gambling taxes differ from state to state. Some states don’t tax gambling income at all, while others tax it quite heavily. In some states, the tax laws are very complex, with a variety of different rates and exemptions depending on the type of gambling involved.

In general, though, gambling income is taxable in the United States. If you win money gambling, you have to report it on your federal income tax return. You may also have to pay state and local taxes on your gambling income, depending on where you live.

The amount of tax you owe on your gambling income depends on how much money you win and how often you win it. Gambling income is taxed as regular income, so the highest rate usually applies. In 2017, the top federal income tax rate was 39.6 percent.

There are a few exceptions to this rule. Gambling losses can be deducted from your gambling income, for example. And if you file a joint return, you and your spouse can each deduct up to $3,000 in losses per year (or $1,500 per person if you file separately).

You can read more about the specific tax rules for gambling in each state in Publication 529, “Tax Information for Gamblers.” This publication is available on the IRS website (https://www.irs.gov/publications/p529/).

If you have questions about how gambling taxes apply to you, be sure to speak with a qualified tax professional.

Other states with high gambling taxes include Pennsylvania (9%), Illinois (8%), and Indiana (7%).

#  Are You Owed Money from a Gambling Tax Refund?

If you're a U.S. citizen and have made any gambling-related tax payments in the past, you may be owed a gambling tax refund. The amount of this refund will depend on how much tax you've paid on your gambling income and casino winnings over the years.

Figuring out whether or not you're due a gambling tax refund can be tricky, as there are many different factors to take into account. The first step is to gather all of your past gambling-related tax documents, including Forms 1040, W-2G, and 5754. Once you have all of this information together, you can start to calculate how much money you're owed.

There are a few different ways to go about doing this. One method is to subtract your total gambling losses from your total gambling income. If this results in a positive number, you're owed a refund! Another approach is to calculate the percentage of your net winnings that was subject to taxes. Whatever method you choose, make sure to use the most recent information available to get the most accurate calculation possible.

Once you've determined how much money you're owed, it's time to start the process of claiming your refund. You'll need to fill out Form 8849, Claim for Refund of Excise Taxes, and submit it with your other tax forms. Be aware that there may be some restrictions on who is eligible for a gambling tax refund; for example, if you've already received a similar refund in past years or if you live in a state that doesn't levy a gambling tax.

If all of this seems like too much work, don't worry - there are plenty of online calculators and resources available that can help make the process simpler. So if you think you might be entitled to a gambling tax refund, don't hesitate to investigate further and see if you can claim your fair share!

#  How to Report Gambling Winnings and Losses for Tax Purposes

Are you a gambler? If so, you need to report your gambling winnings and losses on your tax return. Here's how to do it.

To report your gambling winnings and losses, you'll need to complete IRS Form 1040, Schedule A. This form is used to report itemized deductions.

On Schedule A, you'll need to list your gambling winnings and losses for the year. You'll also need to provide your total amount of losses for the year. This is the amount of money you lost gambling, not the amount of money you won.

Your gambling losses can be deducted as a miscellaneous deduction on Schedule A. This means they will be subject to a 2% limit on all itemized deductions. This limit applies whether or not you itemize your other deductions.

There are a few things to keep in mind when reporting your gambling winnings and losses:

- You must report all of your gambling winnings, even if they are from sources that are not taxable. This includes winnings from lotteries, raffles, horse races, and games of chance.

- You must report any gambling winnings that are equal to or more than $600 for the year.

- You can only deduct your losses if you have documentation to support them. This documentation can include receipts, tickets, canceled checks, and statements from the casino or other gaming establishment.

- If you have both wins and losses for the year, you will net them against each other. This means that any net loss can be deducted as a Miscellaneous Deduction on Schedule A.
