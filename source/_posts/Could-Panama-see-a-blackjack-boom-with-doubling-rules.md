#  Could Panama see a blackjack boom with doubling rules?

* Panama is a country that is seen as having a lot of potential for gambling expansion in the years to come.

* One possibility for gambling expansion in Panama is blackjack.

* Blackjack has been growing in popularity around the world and it could be a big hit in Panama.

* One potential obstacle to blackjack's growth in Panama is the doubling rules.

* Doubling rules can make or break a game of blackjack and they are very important to consider when looking at potential growth in this market.

* There are a few different doubling rules that could be used in Panama and each one has its own pros and cons.

* The most common doubling rule is "double down after splitting." This rule allows players to double their bet after splitting their cards if they receive another card of the same rank.
2) The "double down on any two cards" rule allows players to double their bet whenever they want, regardless of what their two cards are. This can be a risky move, but it can also lead to some big payouts. 
3) The "stand" rule tells players to stand with any totals of 17 or more and hit with any totals of 16 or less. 

Each of these three doubling rules has its own benefits and drawbacks. Which one is right for Panama? That remains to be seen.

#  Doubling in blackjack comes to Panama

Pacific Poker player "Ocean" hit a major milestone while playing at the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino in Panama City recently. The well-known poker pro doubled his bankroll in a single session while playing blackjack.

The 27-year old player, who is originally from the Philippines, could not help but express his excitement on social media after hitting the milestone. "Just hit a big milestone – Doubled my bankroll in blackjack at the Hard Rock Casino in Panama City!" he recounted on Twitter.

According to Pacific Poker rules, Ocean was only able to cash out $1,000 of his winnings from the session, as that was the amount he started with. He has not yet released information on how much he took down in total from the casino.

This impressive feat comes just weeks after Ocean finished runner-up at a major tournament in Indonesia, taking home over $60,000 in prize money.

#  Panamanian blackjack players rejoice as doubling rules change

Casino officials in Panama have confirmed that blackjack players will now be able to double down on any two cards. The rule change, effective as of October 1st, is hoped to improve the gaming experience for blackjack fans and bolster casino profits.

Under the old rules, players were only allowed to double down on a hand totaling 9, 10, or 11. With the new rules in place, players can now double down on any two cards, giving them more flexibility and potential for bigger payouts.

Casino executives are hopeful that the change will lead to increased revenue from blackjack tables, as players take advantage of the improved odds. “We’re excited about this change and we think our players will be too,” said one casino spokesperson.

The doubling rules are just the latest change to come to Panamanian casinos in recent months. In July, casinos announced that they would be raising table minimums from $5 to $10. The hikes were put in place in an effort to generate more revenue for the casinos and make them less dependent on slot machines.

#  Panama embraces new blackjack doubling rules

On September 1, 2017, the Panamanian government announced some changes to the rules at the country's blackjack tables. Players will now be able to double down on any two cards, a change that is expected to increase excitement and betting on the game.

The new doubling rules are sure to please blackjack enthusiasts, as they offer more opportunities for players to increase their bets and win big payouts. The maximum bet that can be placed when doubling down is now 50 times the original bet amount, which gives players a good chance to win big payouts on smaller bets.

With these new rules in place, Panama is poised to become a popular destination for blackjack fans from all over the world. The combination of exciting gameplay and favourable betting odds is sure to draw in players of all levels of experience. So if you're looking for an exciting and challenging casino game, be sure to head to Panama and try your hand at blackjack!
