#  Dodgers and Giants Battle for NL West Supremacy

This year’s NL West race is shaping up to be one for the ages. The Dodgers and Giants are locked in a tight battle for supremacy, with each team taking turns leading the division.

The Dodgers got off to a hot start, but the Giants have been playing even better as of late. They currently sit just one game back of Los Angeles.

ClayTON Kershaw and Madison Bumgarner are the two biggest stars in this rivalry. Kershaw has been dominant in recent years, while Bumgarner is one of the most dependable pitchers in all of baseball.

The Dodgers have some other impressive players as well, including Corey Seager and Cody Bellinger. But the Giants have their own talented roster, headlined by Buster Posey and Brandon Crawford.

This is sure to be an exciting race to watch all season long. The Dodgers and Giants are both excellent teams, and it’s going to take everything they have to come out on top.

#  Rockies, Padres and Diamondbacks Vie for Final Wild Card Spot 

The final week of the MLB regular season is upon us, and the three teams vying for the last wild card spot in each league are the Colorado Rockies, San Diego Padres and Arizona Diamondbacks in the National League, and the Baltimore Orioles, Detroit Tigers and Tampa Bay Rays in the American League.

The Rockies currently have a one-game lead on the Padres and Diamondbacks, while the Orioles have a two-game lead on the Tigers and Rays. Let's take a look at each team's odds of reaching the postseason.

In the National League: 

The Rockies (87-74) have a 37.5% chance of reaching the postseason, while the Padres (86-75) have a 36.4% chance and the Diamondbacks (85-76) have a 26.1% chance. 

In the American League: 

The Orioles (89-72) have a 47.6% chance of reaching the postseason, while the Tigers (88-73) have a 38.9% chance and the Rays (87-74) have a 13.6% chance.

#  Dodgers Clinch Division Title as Giants Fall Short 

LOS ANGELES- In a season that has seen its ups and downs, the Dodgers have finally clinched their 5th consecutive division title. The Giants, on the other hand, have failed to make the playoffs for the 3rd consecutive year.

The Dodgers got off to a shaky start, losing their first four games of the season. However, they managed to recover and went on to win 104 games, the most in team history.

The Giants had an even more turbulent season. After starting out hot with a 19-10 record, they went into a tailspin and finished the season with just 73 wins.

The Dodgers' success was largely due to their dominant rotation. Led by Clayton Kershaw and Walker Buehler, the Dodgers' starters had a combined 2.92 ERA, the lowest in baseball. The Giants' rotation was much less consistent, posting a 4.51 ERA (24th in MLB).

Offensively, Cody Bellingeronce again led the way for the Dodgers. He hit .305 with 47 home runs and 115 RBIs. His power was especially valuable in close games; he hit .412 with 11 home runs and 28 RBIs in late and close situations (defined as innings 7-9 or innings 10-11with the game tied or within one run). Bellinger was named NL MVP earlier this week.

The Giants offense was led by Brandon Belt, who hit .280 with 23 home runs and 84 RBIs. However, no other Giant hit more than 16 home runs or drove in more than 60 runs.

In the end, it was simply too much for the Giants to overcome. They were outplayedin almost every facet of the game and will miss the playoffs for only the second time since 2008. The Dodgers are now one step closer to their ultimate goal: winning their first World Series since 1988

#  Rockies Shock Dodgers with Late Rally to Win NL West 

In what could only be seen as a shocking turn of events, the Colorado Rockies rallied in the 9th inning to overtake the division-leading Los Angeles Dodgers and win the National League West.

The Rockies began the season as one of the most surprising teams in baseball, racing out to an impressive early-season record on the back of some hot starting pitching. However, they hit a rough patch in late August and early September, losing 11 of their last 14 games and ceding first place to the Dodgers.

Entering Wednesday night's game, it appeared that the Dodgers were on verge of clinching their 6th consecutive NL West title. With a magic number of just 1, they only needed to win or have the Rockies lose one game to lock up the division.

But things didn't go according to plan. The Dodgers bullpen imploded in the 9th inning, giving up 5 runs as Colorado stormed back to win 9-6 and take first place by 2 games with just 2 games left to play. 

"This is a great moment for us," said Nolan Arenado after the game. "We fought hard all year and we deserve this." 

The Rockies will now face off against the Milwaukee Brewers in the Wild Card Game on Tuesday night. If they can pull off another upset victory, they'll advance to face the Atlanta Braves in the National League Division Series.

#  Padres Surge Late to Secure Playoff Berth, Eliminating Diamondbacks

The San Diego Padres secured their first playoff berth in nine years by rallying late to beat the Arizona Diamondbacks, 5-3, on Monday night.

With the victory, the Padres (91-71) eliminated the Diamondbacks (89-73) from contention for the second National League wild card. The Milwaukee Brewers (92-70) also clinched a playoff berth with a victory over the St. Louis Cardinals.

Hunter Renfroe hit a two-run homer in the eighth inning to give the Padres the lead, and Manny Margot added an insurance run with an RBI single in the ninth. Kirby Yates closed out the game for his 41st save.

The Phillies (80-82) could still overtake the Padres for third place in the NL West, but San Diego would win a tiebreaker based on its head-to-head record against Philadelphia.

Padres starter Eric Lauer allowed three runs in six innings while striking out seven batters. Robbie Ray gave up four runs in five innings for Arizona.

San Diego will host the Rockies in a one-game playoff on Wednesday to determine who advances to face the Braves in the NL Division Series.
