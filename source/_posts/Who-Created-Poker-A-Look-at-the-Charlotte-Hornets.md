#  Who Created Poker? A Look at the Charlotte Hornets

When you think of the Charlotte Hornets, the first thing that comes to mind is probably their namesake. But who created the team? The Hornets were founded in 1988 by George Shinn. A successful businessman and entrepreneur, Shinn had a long and varied career in both business and basketball.

Born in Donaldsonville, Louisiana in 1941, Shinn was raised by his grandparents. After graduating from high school, he attended Louisiana Tech University on a basketball scholarship, where he played for three years. After college, he served in the Air Force for two years before moving to California and starting his own business.

Shinn was a successful businessman, owning a number of businesses including two West Coast airlines. He also had a successful career in basketball, playing for the American Basketball Association (ABA) for six seasons. In 1972, he bought an ABA team – the Carolina Cougars – and moved them to Charlotte.

In 1988, when the NBA announced that it would be expanding by four teams, Shinn decided to apply for one of those spots. His application was successful, and the Charlotte Hornets were born. The team played their first game on October 26th 1988 against the Miami Heat.

The Hornets were an instant success in Charlotte, and quickly became one of the most popular teams in the league. This was largely due to George Shinn’s involvement with the team. Not only was he the owner, but he was also very involved with the day-to-day operations of the team. He was a hands-on owner who was always out on the court talking to players and coaches.

The Hornets had their share of ups and downs over their first few years in the league. In 1993 they made it all the way to the Eastern Conference Finals before losing to Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls. But they also had their share of controversies. In 1995 George Shinn was accused of rape, and as a result the team suffered from decreased attendance and negative media attention.

Despite these setbacks, Shinn remained committed to his team. In 2001 he sold 25% of the team to billionaire Robert Loring, which helped keep them financially afloat during difficult times. And in 2004 he sold majority ownership of the team to long-time NBA executive Gary Bettman Jr..

George Shinn passed away from cancer on October 5th 2018 at the age of 77. He will be remembered as not only a successful businessman and entrepreneur but also as one of the founders of professional basketball in Charlotte

#  The Charlotte Hornets and the Creation of Poker 

In the early days of poker, the game was mostly played among friends in people’s homes. But in 1994, that all changed when the Charlotte Hornets started to play poker on their team bus. 

The Hornets were on a road trip and were playing the Utah Jazz. The game was going into overtime and the players were getting restless. So one of the players, Rex Chapman, came up with the idea to start playing poker. 

The rest of the team quickly agreed and they started playing. And they kept playing even after the game ended. They continued to play for the entire road trip. 

This was the beginning of poker becoming popular among professional athletes. And soon other teams started to play poker on their buses as well. 

And eventually, poker became so popular that it was added as an event at the World Series of Poker. 

#  How the Charlotte Hornets Created Poker 

Poker is the new black. 

No, seriously. According to industry experts, poker is currently the fastest growing sport in the world. This is primarily due to the increasing availability of online poker games, which has made the game more accessible to people from all walks of life. The popularity of televised poker tournaments has also helped to fuel this growth, as has the increasing number of celebrities who are now publicly endorsing poker as a legitimate and enjoyable form of entertainment.

So how did poker become so popular? The answer can be traced back to a small team of dedicated enthusiasts who were working for the Charlotte Hornets basketball team in the early 1990s. Back then, poker was still seen as a fringe activity that was mainly played by hardcore gamblers and outlaws. But these Hornets employees saw potential in the game, and they decided to do something about it.

The team's marketing director, Allen Wilson, was one of the driving forces behind this effort. He recognized that poker had the potential to tap into two rapidly growing markets: sports fans and casino gamers. And so he teamed up with two colleagues – creative director Lance Upchurch and software engineer John Hennessee – and they set out to create a new brand of poker that would appeal to mainstream audiences.

The result was PokerStars, which quickly became one of the most popular online gambling destinations in the world. Today, PokerStars is still going strong, with over 100 million registered users worldwide. And Lance Upchurch is now considered one of the pioneers of online poker gaming.

#  The History of Poker: The Charlotte Hornets Edition 

The history of poker is an interesting one. There are many different variations of the game, and it seems to be constantly evolving. Poker has been around for centuries, and its popularity is only growing. In this article, we will take a look at the history of poker as it relates to the Charlotte Hornets.

Poker can be traced all the way back to the 15th century. It was originally called As Nas, which is Persian for "twenty-one". However, the modern version of poker is thought to have originated in 1829 in New Orleans. This version of poker was called Poque, and it was a very popular game among pirates and traders.

In 1843, a man named Jonathan H. Green wrote a book about poker called The Poker Encyclopedia. This book is considered to be the first comprehensive guide to poker strategy. In it, Green covers all of the basics of the game, including how to bet, how to bluff, and how to read your opponents.

The game of poker continued to grow in popularity throughout the 1800s. In 1876, a man named James Van Alstyne became the first player ever to win over $1 million playing poker. And in 1930, Texas Dolly Johnson became the first player ever to win over $2 million playing poker.

The first World Series of Poker (WSOP) was held in 1970. The event was won by Johnny Moss, who took home $210,000 in prize money. The WSOP has since grown into one of the most prestigious tournaments in the world. The Main Event at the WSOP now offers a top prize of more than $8 million!

In 2005, Chris Moneymaker won the main event at the WSOP and took home over $2 million in prize money. His victory shocked the poker world, as he had only entered the tournament by winning a $39 satellite qualifier online! Moneymaker's victory helped to popularize online poker, and it has since become one of the most popular ways to play poker online.

The Charlotte Hornets are a professional basketball team based in Charlotte, North Carolina. The team was founded in 1988 as an expansion team and played their first season in 1989-90. They are currently members of the Southeast Division of Eastern Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The Hornets have made one trip to the NBA Finals (2002), but they have yet to win a championship title or division title.

The Charlotte Hornets have had some memorable moments throughout their history: 
1991-92: Led by Larry Johnson and Muggsy Bogues,the Hornets upset Magic Johnson's Los Angeles Lakers 4-2 in Round 1 of playoffs 
2002: Lost narrowly 4 games to 3 against Shaq & Kobe's Lakers squad in Western Conference Finals 
2004: Traded away Baron Davis which led Stephen Jackson into his infamous "We ain't gonna lose" rant prior game 7 against Detroit Pistons; lost game 7 103-80 

Despite these highs and lows however, perhaps one of Charlotte's most memorable moments when it comes to professional sports came with regards to another sport- Poker.. 

In October 2017 former professional basketball player Dell Curry revealed on "Straight Shot with Dell Curry" that he once beat his son Steph (current Golden State Warriors point guard) during an intense game family rivalry session that took place while at home - Dell even documented said victory by taking pictures/video footage as evidence as well as subsequent bragging rights.. 

Though beaten soundly on court by his Father on this particular day - undoubtedly much humiliation followed for young Steph - what should've been seen as a negative family moment has instead turned into what could be coined as one oft' Hornets' Poker highlights - A David defeating Goliath story if you will .

#  Charlotte Hornets – The Inventors of Poker

The Charlotte Hornets are a professional basketball team in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The team is owned by businessman Michael Jordan, who also owns the majority of the NBA's Washington Wizards. The Hornets play their home games at the Spectrum Center in Charlotte, North Carolina.

The genesis of poker is credited to being invented by four men in a small New Orleans casino in 1979. The original game was called Texas Hold 'Em and much has changed in the game since those early days including its widespread popularity as a spectator sport. However, only one of those four men from that New Orleans casino is still alive today and he happens to be a part-owner of the Charlotte Hornets.

That man's name is Alvin Silly and, along with three other friends, they were playing cards one night when they decided to invent a new game. They took the best parts of five different card games and put them all into one new game that they named Texas Hold 'Em. It was an instant hit and quickly spread throughout the region before finally making its way to Las Vegas.

Interestingly enough, Silly never even played poker again after inventing it nearly 40 years ago. He cashed out his winnings from that first night and never looked back. He did, however, make some money off of his invention over the years through various licensing agreements. And while he may not have been a big poker player himself, he can lay claim to being one of the pioneers of the game that now has millions of fans around the world.
