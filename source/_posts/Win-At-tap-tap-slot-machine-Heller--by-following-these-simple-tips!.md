#  How To Play tap tap slot machine Heller Like A Pro! 

People love playing casino games and the thrill it gives. Slot machines are one of the most popular casino games and offer a great deal of excitement to players. However, some people find it difficult to win at slot machines, even if they are using proper strategy. In this article, we will teach you how to play the Heller machine like a pro!

Firstly, you need to understand how the Heller machine works. The Heller machine has three spinning wheels with different pictures on them. As the wheels start spinning, you need to tap the screen when you see a picture that matches the one on the wheel. If you tap at the right time, your bet will be multiplied by the number shown on the wheel. If you tap at the wrong time, your bet will be lost.

The key to winning at Heller machine is to keep track of what pictures have already appeared on the wheels and make sure you don't tap on those pictures again. For example, if two hearts have already appeared on the wheels, then don't tap on any more hearts because your bet will be lost.

Another thing to keep in mind is that you can only win up to ten times your original bet amount. So if you have a $10 bet and hit a jackpot multiplier of 10x, your payout will be $100 (10x$10). However, if you hit a jackpot multiplier of 9x or below, your payout will be rounded down to $10.

Now that you know how to play Heller like a pro, it's time to put your skills into practice!
