# Gaming Could Mean Billions in Tax Revenue

Governments around the world are always on the lookout for new sources of tax revenue, and it seems that they may have found one in the form of gaming.

According to a report from PwC, the global gaming market is expected to grow from $137.9 billion in 2018 to $240.5 billion by 2022. If this forecast is accurate, it would mean an increase in tax revenue of around $44 billion over the next four years.

This growth is being driven by several factors, including the increasing popularity of mobile games, the growing esports market, and the expansion of gaming into new geographies.

China is expected to be the largest gaming market in the world by 2022, accounting for more than one-third of global spending. The US and Japan will be the second and third largest markets, respectively.

Gaming is a major contributor to the economy in many countries and it’s great to see that governments are starting to recognise its potential as a source of tax revenue. This could be just the beginning – as gaming continues to grow in popularity, we can expect even more revenue to be generated from this industry.

# Legalized Gaming Could Bring in $1 Billion in Taxes Annually

Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York has announced his intent to legalize and tax gaming in the state in an effort to bring in an estimated $1 billion in new revenue. If passed, the legislation would allow for up to seven Las Vegas-style casinos, as well as authorize other forms of gambling, such as online poker and sports betting.

Cuomo made the announcement on Thursday morning at a Manhattan casino, pointing to the potential windfall for education and infrastructure projects. "This is a major step forward to realizing the potential of Upstate New York," he said.

The governor's proposal has already come under fire from some lawmakers, who argue that it would create more gambling addiction problems. However, Cuomo is confident that the increase in jobs and tourism brought about by legalized gaming will outweigh any potential downsides.

If passed, New York would join a number of states that have recently moved to legalize gambling, including Pennsylvania, Iowa, West Virginia, and Illinois. This growing trend is in response to a changing landscape in the gaming industry, where profits are now being generated largely through online platforms rather than traditional brick-and-mortar casinos.

# Gaming Could Yield Nearly $650 Million in Annual Tax Revenue

A recent report from the American Gaming Association (AGA) estimates that gaming could yield nearly $650 million in annual tax revenue for federal, state, and local governments.

The report, “Gaming the System: How Gaming Taxation Can Benefit States and Local Communities,” analyzes the impact of gaming taxes on state and local economies. According to the study, if all states taxed gaming at their maximum rate, they could generate an additional $442 million in tax revenue. In addition, local governments could generate an estimated $211 million in tax revenue from gaming activities.

“Gaming taxation is an important tool that state and local governments can use to support critical public services and programs,” said Geoff Freeman, president and CEO of the American Gaming Association. “This report underscores the significant benefits that come with a well-regulated gaming industry, including jobs and economic growth. We urge lawmakers to take a closer look at how they can partner with the gaming industry to generate much-needed revenue for critical public services.”

Freeman noted that many state and local governments are facing budgetary shortfalls and sought to highlight how taxing gambling can be part of the solution. The study found that for every dollar spent on gambling in a state or locality, $0.70 is generated in tax revenue. This amounts to an overall effective tax rate of 7 percent on gambling spending.

States with the highest effective tax rates on gambling are Illinois (14 percent), Iowa (13 percent), New Jersey (12 percent), and Pennsylvania (12 percent). The states with the lowest effective tax rates are Louisiana (1 percent), Mississippi (3 percent), Oklahoma (3 percent), and Texas (3 percent).

While there is no one-size-fits-all answer when it comes to taxation, the AGA report offers policymakers a look at how they can tap into this potential source of revenue. As more states legalize sports betting in the wake of last year’s Supreme Court decision in Murphy v. NCAA, it will be increasingly important for policymakers to consider the impact of gaming taxation on state and local budgets.

# New York Poised to Gain $430 Million Annually from Gaming

The New York State Gaming Commission released a report indicating that the state could gain up to $430 million in annual revenue from gaming. The commission also stated that the state’s 10 casinos could create as many as 23,000 jobs.

Most of the money is expected to come from video lottery terminals (VLTs), which could generate $380 million in revenue. The casinos are also expected to bring in an additional $50 million annually from table games and slot machines.

Governor Cuomo applauded the findings of the report, stating that it “reinforces what we have known all along: Properly regulated gaming will be a major engine of job creation and economic growth for New Yorkers.”

The New York State Gaming Commission was established in 2012 with the goal of responsibly expanding gaming in New York State. The commission held 16 public hearings and interviewed more than 150 witnesses in order to draft the report.

The release of the report comes as state legislators are considering a bill that would authorize four new casinos and one new Indian casino in New York.

# Legalized Gaming Could Mean Over $350 Million in New Tax Revenue

_States are considering legalizing gaming in order to bring in new tax revenue. A recent study by a gaming research firm shows that if just 10 percent of the population participates in legalized gaming, it could generate over $350 million in new tax revenue._

Casinos have been legal in Nevada since 1931, and yet the state continues to be a leader in gaming revenue. In 2016, Nevada casinos brought in over $11 billion. Clearly, there is something about legalized gaming that attracts players and generates significant tax revenue.

Other states are starting to take notice. In November 2017, voters in Arkansas approved a constitutional amendment to allow casino gambling. If casinos open in Arkansas, the state stands to gain over $100 million per year in new tax revenue.

Other states considering legalizing gaming include Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri, New York, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. These states are looking at different types of gaming including casinos, lotteries, and sports betting.

The potential for new tax revenue is significant. For example, if Pennsylvania legalizes casino gambling and 10 percent of the population participates, the state could generate over $400 million per year in new tax revenue. That’s a lot of money that could be used for education or infrastructure improvements.

Legalized gaming is not without its detractors. Some people feel that it can be addictive and lead to financial ruin. Others argue that it can lead to crime and corruption. However, proponents point to the fact that regulated gaming can create jobs and promote tourism.

It will be interesting to see how this debate plays out across the country. In the meantime, voters in individual states will need to decide whether they want to legalize gaming and enjoy the benefits of increased tax revenue.
