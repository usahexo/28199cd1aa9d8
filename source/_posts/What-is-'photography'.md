#  What is 'photography'?

There is no one, definitive answer to this question.

But at its simplest, photography is the art and science of capturing light on a photosensitive surface (such as film or a digital sensor) to create an image.

Light can be captured in a number of ways - with a camera obscura, for example, or with a simple pinhole camera.

And while photography has been around for centuries, the digital age has brought about new ways of capturing and manipulating images.

#  What inspires artists to create photography?

There are many reasons why artists are drawn to photography. Some may find the process of taking a photograph to be therapeutic, while others may enjoy the challenge of capturing a perfect moment. Whatever the reason, photography has the ability to inspire and move people in ways other art forms cannot.

One of the things that makes photography so unique is its ability to freeze time. By capturing an image, an artist can share a moment with others that they would have otherwise missed. This can be especially powerful when it comes to documenting historic events or everyday life.

Photography can also be incredibly beautiful. There is something about seeing a photograph that evokes emotion in people, whether it’s happiness, sadness, anger or love. Photographs can take us on a journey to far-off places or make us feel like we’ve been transported back in time. They can make us see the world in a new way and remind us of how precious life is.

In the hands of a skilled artist, photography can be a tool for storytelling and communication. By sharing their photographs, artists can create connections with others and help them see the world in a different light. Photography has the power to change people’s perceptions and inspire them to do great things.

#  How has photography changed over the years?

The history of photography is rich and varied, with many different styles and techniques emerging over the years. While photography has always been used to capture memories and moments, its role has changed significantly over time.

In the early days of photography, the process was slow and cumbersome. It could take hours to capture a single photo. This meant that photography was mainly used for documenting events or important historical moments.

With the advent of digital technology, photography has become much more accessible and faster to produce. This has led to a proliferation of photo sharing online, with people capturing every moment of their lives and sharing them on social media.

In recent years, there has also been a trend towards more creative and experimental forms of photography. This includes using alternative methods such as light painting or creating photos using mixed media.

Overall, photography has come a long way since it was first invented in 1839. It is now widely used for capturing memories, telling stories and making art.

#  What is the difference between a good and bad photograph?

This is a question that has been asked by photographers and photo enthusiasts for years. What makes a good photograph? Is it the composition? The lighting? The subject matter? While all of these elements certainly contribute to the make-up of a good photograph, there is one overarching factor that trumps them all – emotion.

A good photograph is not simply a record of what was photographed, but rather, it is an image that stirs an emotion in the viewer. It might make them happy, sad, angry, nostalgic, or any number of other emotions. But if it doesn’t evoke an emotional response in some way, then it’s likely not a very good photograph.

This is not to say that technical aspects of photography are unimportant. Quite the contrary – having a strong technical foundation is essential for creating photographs that evoke emotion. However, if your photos are technically perfect but they don’t move people on an emotional level, then they are likely forgettable.

Emotion is what sets great photos apart from mediocre ones, and it’s what makes people want to look at them time and time again. So if you want to take your photography to the next level, focus on evoking emotion in your images. And don’t be afraid to experiment – there is no single recipe for creating emotionally powerful photos.

#  Who decides what is art and what is not?

For centuries, the question of what is and is not art has been debated by both experts and laypeople alike. While some might argue that there is a definitive answer to this question, others believe that it is a matter of personal opinion. What all parties seem to agree on, however, is that the definition of art is not always clear-cut. In many cases, it is up to the individual to decide what they consider to be art.

One of the reasons why the definition of art is so difficult to nail down is because it can encompass a wide range of mediums and disciplines. Some might consider a painting by Vincent van Gogh to be artwork, while others might disagree and say that only certain types of art are worthy of this label. Similarly, some people might deem a piece of furniture to be an example of art, while others might see it as a functional object.

So, who gets to decide what is and is not art? In most cases, it is up to the artist themselves to determine how their work should be classified. They may choose to call their creation an artwork, or they may refer to it as something else altogether. Ultimately, it is up to the individual to decide what they want their work to be called.

There are also times when the general public gets to weigh in on what constitutes as art. This tends to happen when there is disagreement among experts about whether or not a particular work should be considered art. In these situations, the general public often has the final say in whether or not something counts as an artwork.

As you can see, there are many different factors that go into determining what qualifies as art. It can be a complex topic with no easy answers. Ultimately, it is up to each individual person to decide for themselves what they believe constitutes as an artwork.
