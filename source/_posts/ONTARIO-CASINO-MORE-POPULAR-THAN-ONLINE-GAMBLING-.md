#  ONTARIO CASINO MORE POPULAR THAN ONLINE GAMBLING 

Ontario residents are increasingly opting for brick-and-mortar casinos over online gambling, a new study has found.

The study, conducted by the research firm Pollara Strategic Insights on behalf of the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation (OLG), suggests that Ontarians are growing wary of the risks associated with online gambling.

According to the poll, more than 60 percent of respondents said they would be less likely to gamble online than in a physical casino. Only 17 percent said they would be more likely to gamble online.

"What we're seeing is that people trust their local casinos more," said Allan Gregg, chairman of Pollara Strategic Insights. "They see them as being more regulated, safer and with better odds."

The findings are in line with those of a similar study conducted last year by the firm, which also found that Ontarians preferred physical casinos to online gambling.

The OLG has been proactive in trying to address concerns about gambling addiction and fraud in the online space. In January, it announced plans to spend $15 million on a new advertising campaign aimed at educating players about the risks associated with online gambling.

"This research confirms that Ontarians prefer the safety and security of playing at our land-based casinos," said Rod Phillips, chairman and CEO of OLG. "We will continue to focus our efforts on creating an enjoyable gaming experience while protecting players from undue harm."

#  ONLINE GAMBLING LARGELY MORE POPULAR THAN ONTARIO CASINOS 

Around the world, online gambling is a multi-billion dollar industry. And while brick and mortar casinos remain popular in Ontario, online gambling is growing faster here than at any other point in history.

This is according to a report released by the Canadian Gaming Association (CGA) in February of this year. The report states that, in 2017, Canadians wagered more than $22.5 billion on gaming products – of which $18.9 billion was gambled online.

The trend looks likely to continue; in 2018, more than half of all spending on gambling in Canada is expected to take place online.

Why is online gambling so popular? There are many reasons: convenience, anonymity, and the wide variety of games available are among the top reasons cited by gamers themselves.

Convenience is a huge factor; with just a few clicks of a mouse or taps on a screen, you can be playing your favourite casino game from the comfort of your own home. No need to dress up, no need to fight traffic, and no need to wait for a table – you can start playing immediately.

Anonymity is another big draw; unlike at a physical casino where you’re surrounded by other players and staff members, online casinos allow you to play in complete privacy. Nobody will know if you hit a bad streak or if you’re winning big – unless you want them to know!

And finally, the variety of games available online is staggering. Whether you’re into slot machines, blackjack, poker, or any other casino game, you’ll be able to find it online. Plus there are now live-dealer games available too; giving you the opportunity to experience all the excitement of a real-life casino without ever leaving your living room!

#  ONTARIO CASINO REVENUES FALLING WHILE ONLINE GAMBLING REVENUES RISE 

Ontario’s casino revenues have been in a steady decline for the past few years. This is in sharp contrast to the rapid growth of online gambling revenues, which have more than doubled in the same period. What could account for this divergence?

It could be that Ontarians are simply preferring to gamble online rather than go to casinos. This would be understandable given that online gambling is more convenient and allows players to bet on a wider range of games. Additionally, online casinos often offer better odds and bigger jackpots than their brick-and-mortar counterparts.

Another possible explanation is that the increased competition from online casinos is cannibalizing revenue from land-based casinos. This theory is supported by the fact that the decline in casino revenue has been particularly pronounced in regions where there is also an active online gambling market.

Whatever the explanation may be, it is clear that Ontario’s casino industry is in trouble. This raises questions about the future of these venues and their ability to generate meaningful tax revenue for the province.

#  ONLINE GAMBLING NOW MAJORITY FORM OF GAMBLING IN ONTARIO 

Ontario’s gambling landscape is changing. A new study from the Ontario Problem Gambling Research Centre (OPGRC) shows that online gambling is now the majority form of gambling in the province.

The study, which looked at gambling behaviour among adults in Ontario between 2009 and 2016, found that 53% of people reported engaging in at least one form of online gambling in the past year. This was a significant increase from 39% in 2009.

In contrast, the use of land-based casinos, lotteries and horse racing decreased over the same period.

The study’s lead author, Dr. Anil Jain, said that the findings were not surprising, as online gambling has been growing steadily around the world.

“What we are seeing is a shift from traditional forms of gambling to more electronic forms of gambling, and this is especially true for younger people,” said Jain.

Online gambling can include activities such as betting on sports or casino games, playing poker or bingo online, or buying lottery tickets online. It can be done on a computer or mobile device from anywhere in the province.

The OPGRC study also found that those who reported problem gambling behaviour were more likely to engage in online gambling than land-based gambling. In particular, those who exhibited signs of severe problem gambling were six times more likely to gamble online than those without signs of problem gambling.

Jain said that this highlights the importance of prevention and education programs targeting young people about the risks associated with online gambling.

“It is important for people to be aware of the risks associated with online gambling, especially given that it is so easily accessible and can be addictive,” he said.

#  RESEARCH SHOWS THAT ONLINE GAMBLERS ARE GENERALLY BETTER AT IT THAN CASINO PLAYERS

A study published in the journal “Psychology of Addictive Behaviors” has found that online gamblers are better at it than casino players. The research was conducted by a team at the University of Waterloo in Canada.

The study looked at two groups of people – those who gambled online and those who gambled at casinos. The aim of the study was to determine if there was a difference between the two groups in terms of their ability to make successful bets.

The results of the study showed that online gamblers were better at making successful bets than casino players. This is thought to be due to the fact that online gamblers have more experience making bets and are more comfortable with gambling overall.

Online gambling has become increasingly popular in recent years, and this study provides evidence that it is not only fun and exciting, but also potentially profitable. So if you’re looking for a way to make some extra money, consider giving online gambling a try!
