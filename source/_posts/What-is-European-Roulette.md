# What is European Roulette?

European Roulette is one of the two main types of roulette, the other being American Roulette. It is a casino game that involves betting on the outcome of a spinning wheel with 37 or 38 slots. These include a green slot numbered 0, and another colored red or black slot numbered 1-36. European Roulette also has a single zero slot.

Bets are placed on individual numbers, groups of numbers, colors, or whether the number will be odd or even. The bettor can also bet whether the ball will fall into one of several designated areas on the wheel called “ Streets .”



European Roulette is popular in casinos throughout Europe and beyond.

# How do you play European Roulette?

 European roulette is one of the most popular casino games in the world. The game is simple to play, but can be very lucrative for those who understand the odds and how to take advantage of them.

In European roulette, there are 37 numbered slots on the wheel, from 0 to 36. Players place bets on what slot the ball will end up in, and then the wheel is spun. If your bet is correct, you win!

There are a number of different bets that can be made in European roulette. The simplest is simply betting on a single number. This pays out at 35-1 if you guess correctly. There are also bets that can be made on sets of numbers, either vertical or horizontal lines, or corners of the board. The odds vary depending on which bet you make, but typically pay out at 2-1 or 3-1 if they come in.

The most important thing to understand when playing European roulette is the house edge. This is the percentage of each bet that the casino takes as profit. In European roulette, the house edge is 2.7%. This means that for every $100 you bet, the casino will keep $2.70 as profit. While this may not seem like a lot, it can add up over time. It’s important to factor this into your betting strategy if you want to have any hope of winning in the long run!

# What are the rules of European Roulette?

European Roulette is a casino game where players bet on the outcome of a spinning wheel. The game uses a single, zero-spaced numbered wheel and bets are placed on either individual numbers or groups of numbers. Winning bets are paid out at odds based on the player's initial bet.

The object of the game is to correctly predict where the ball will come to rest on the wheel after it has spun. Players can bet on a single number, or they can bet on any range of numbers by placing their chips in one of the boxes surrounding the table layout.

There are a total of 37 pockets on the roulette wheel - 18 red, 18 black and one green. The ball will come to rest in one of these pockets, and players who have bet on that number will win their stake multiplied by 35:1. If players have placed a bet on two different numbers, and the ball comes to rest between them, they will receive a payout equivalent to 17:1.

Bets can also be placed on odds or evens, red or black, or high (19-36) or low (1-18) numbers. This type of bet pays out at 1:1 if the ball lands on the chosen number, or if it is within the selected range.

# What are the odds in European Roulette?

European Roulette is a popular casino game that uses a wheel with 36 numbered slots and a ball. Players can bet on a range of different outcomes, including the number the ball will land on, whether the number will be odd or even, and colour. The odds of each bet depend on the likelihood of that particular outcome happening.

# Bets on individual numbers

The odds of winning a bet on an individual number are 1 in 36. This means that if you bet £1 on any one number and the ball lands on that number, you will win £36 plus your original stake back. If you bet £10 on any one number and the ball lands on that number, you will win £360 plus your original stake back.

However, betting on an individual number is also the riskiest bet you can make in European Roulette. If you bet £1 on red and the ball lands on black, you will lose your entire stake.

# Odds of winning bets other than individual numbers

Odds of winning other than individual numbers depend on the type of bet you are making. Here are some examples:

Even money bets - These are bets where the odds of winning are 1:1, such as bets on red or black, odd or even, and 1-18 or 19-36. This type of bet pays out exactly what you wagered if you win.

This type of bet pays out twice your original stake if you win.

This type of bet pays out three times your original stake if you win.
