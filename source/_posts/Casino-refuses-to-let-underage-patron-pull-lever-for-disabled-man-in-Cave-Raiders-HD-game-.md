The patron, a 15-year old boy, attempted to do so after he saw an older gentleman having difficulty reaching the lever.

According to security footage from the casino, the young boy was politely turned away by a casino employee who said that it was against policy for anyone other than the disabled person to operate the game. The boy and his mother were visiting from out of town and were only in Las Vegas for a few days.

The management of a popular casino in Las Vegas is standing up for a disabled man who was allegedly denied access to a game because of his disability. The man, who has not been identified, suffers from a condition that leaves him unable to walk without assistance. When he and his caretaker attempted to play the Cave Raiders HD game at the casino, they were told by a staff member that the game was for "people who can walk."

The casino's management has issued a statement denying that any such policy exists, and has even offered the disabled man and his caretaker complimentary tickets to any game of their choice. In addition, the casino has made a donation to a charity that helps people with disabilities. This story serves as a reminder that there are still people out there who are willing to stand up for those who are marginalized and discriminated against.
