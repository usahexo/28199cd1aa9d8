#  How Many Numbers are on a Roulette Wheel?

When it comes to roulette, there are a lot of questions that gamblers have about the game. One of the most common is how many numbers are on a roulette wheel. The answer to this question may surprise you, as there are actually 38 numbers on a standard roulette wheel. This includes the numbers 1-36 as well as 0 and 00.

Understanding a Roulette Wheel

If you want to become a better gambler when playing roulette, it is important to understand how the game works. A roulette wheel consists of 37 or 38 slots, numbered from 1 to 36, plus zero (0) and double zero (00). The slots alternate between red and black, with the 0 and 00 being green. A ball is spun around the outside edge of the wheel and drops into one of the slots, determining the result of that spin.

The Odds of Winning at Roulette

For any given spin of the roulette wheel, there is only one winning number – that number is determined by where the ball ends up. However, because different bets pay out at different rates, there is no one single best way to bet on roulette. The odds for each type of bet are as follows:

Straight up – 35:1

Split bet – 17:1

Street bet (three numbers) – 11:1

Square bet (four numbers) – 8:1

Six line bet (six numbers) – 5:1
