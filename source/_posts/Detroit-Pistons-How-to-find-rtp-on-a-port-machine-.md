#  Detroit Pistons: How to find rtp on a port machine 

The Detroit Pistons are a professional basketball team based in the city of Detroit, Michigan. The team, a member of the National Basketball Association (NBA), made its debut in 1946 as the Fort Wayne Pistons. The Pistons are owned by Tom Gores and coached by Dwane Casey.

The Pistons play their home games at Little Caesars Arena, which they moved into prior to the 2017–18 season. They compete in the Eastern Conference Central Division. The Pistons were founded in Fort Wayne, Indiana as the Fort Wayne Zollner Pistons, a National Basketball League (NBL) team. In 1949, they joined the NBA after the NBL and BAA merged.

The Pistons have won three NBA championships (1989, 1990, 2004), five conference titles (2003–2004, 2005–2006, 2007–2008), six division titles (1989, 1990, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2008), and 15 playoff appearances. They reached the NBA Finals twice in their first nine years of existence but lost both times to the Minneapolis Lakers. In recent years however they have been consistent contenders reaching the Eastern Conference Finals six times between 2007-2018 but have yet to reach another NBA Finals series.

Today we will be discussing how to find rtp on a port machine. 
RTP stands for Real-time Transport Protocol and is used to manage media streams between endpoints in Voice over IP(VoIP) systems such as Skype for Business or Microsoft Teams. By default most firewalls will block this port so you may need to open it up on your firewall if you wish to use VoIP services within your network or allow others outside your network to use them. 
Now that we know a bit more about what RTP is let's take a look at how you can find it on a port machine. 
First we will need to open up command prompt on our machine by pressing Windows Key + R and typing cmd then hitting Enter key or clicking OK button. 
Once command prompt is open type in netstat -aon | findstr ":5061" and hit Enter key on your keyboard 
You should see something similar to what is shown in screenshot below where our highlighted result indicates that RTP is listening on TCP port 5061 which is what we were looking for.

 
If you do not see anything highlighted then that means RTP is not currently listening on any TCP ports so you will need to check with your VoIP service provider or whoever set up your VoIP system to see if there are any specific ports that need to be opened up on your firewall for RTP traffic.

#  How to find rtp on a port machine in Detroit Pistons 

The Detroit Pistons are a professional basketball team that plays in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The Pistons are based in Detroit, Michigan, and play their home games at The Palace of Auburn Hills. The team was founded in 1941 as the Fort Wayne Zollner Pistons, a member of the National Basketball League (NBL). In 1948, the team became a charter member of the NBA after the NBL and the Basketball Association of America merged. They have won three NBL championships, four NBA championships, and nine division titles.

The Detroit Pistons are looking for a new head coach after firing Stan Van Gundy. There are plenty of potential candidates for the job, including Jerry Stackhouse, Dwane Casey, and Kenny Smith. Whoever is hired will need to find a way to get the most out of Blake Griffin and Andre Drummond.

The Detroit Pistons have announced that they will retire Joe Dumars’s number 16 jersey on January 21st, 2018. Dumars played his entire 14-year career with the Pistons and was named finals MVP in 2004. He is also a two-time champion (1989 and 1990) and six-time All-Star.

The Detroit Pistons traded Tobias Harris to the Philadelphia 76ers in exchange for Wilson Chandler, Mike Muscala, Landry Shamet, and two draft picks. Harris is coming off his best season as a pro, averaging 18.6 points per game. The move signals that the Pistons are rebuilding and hope to have more success in the future.

Detroit Pistons is a professional basketball team based in Detroit, Michigan. The Pistons compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the league's Eastern Conference Central Division. The team was founded in 1941 as the Fort Wayne Zollner Pistons, a member of the National Basketball League (NBL). In 1948, the team moved to Detroit and became the Detroit Pistons.

The Detroit Pistons have won two NBA championships, in 1989 and 2004. The team plays its home games at Little Caesars Arena, which opened in September 2017.

The Detroit Pistons are one of the most successful franchises in the NBA, they've won 2 championships and been to 5 Eastern Conference Finals. Here we will show you how to find their rtp on a linux machine. 

First open your terminal and type in `nmap` followed by the IP address of the Detroit Piston's website which is `104.109.178.122`.

     Nmap scan report for 104.109.178.122
     Host is up (0.075s latency).
PORT STATE SERVICE
22/tcp open ssh
80/tcp open http
443/tcp closed https

As you can see from the image above, port 443 is closed for this website meaning that their rtp isn't running on that port. However, ports 22 and 80 are both open which means that their rtp could be running on either of those ports. We can test this further by using ncat to connect to port 22 and 80 on the Detroit Pistons website as shown below:

    ncat -v 104.109.178.122 22
Ncat: Connected to 104.109.178.122:22

GET / HTTP/1.1

Host: 104.109.178.122

You should now see a response from the Detroit Piston's website displayed in your terminal window if their rtp is indeed running on port 22 as shown below:

HEADER: HTTP/1..1 200 OK
DATE: Thu, 04 Jan 2018 07:37:09 GMT
SERVER: Apache/2.4.... mod_bwlimited/1...X-Powered-By: PHP/5.4....ETag: "680f47c8-264"
CONTENT-LENGTH: 6252
CONTENT-TYPE: text/html; charset=UTF-8

If you see this response then it confirms that their rtp is running on port 22 and you can now start streaming their games live! However, if you don't see this response then it means that their rtp is running on port 80 so you'll need to use ncat to connect to it as shown below:

    ncat -v 104 . 109 . 178 . 122 80

#  Finding rtp on a port machine in Detroit Pistons 

This document explains how to find the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) on a machine that is running the Detroit Pistons software. 

First, open a terminal window and type `netstat -a -n` to list all active network connections and their corresponding ports. 

Next, look for any processes that are using RTP port 2025 by running the following command:
 `lsof -ni :2025`. If no processes are listed, then RTP is not currently being used on the machine. 

If RTP is being used, it will be necessary to determine which process is responsible for creating the connection. This can be done by running `ps -aux` and comparing the output of this command with the output of the previous one. 

The process that has the most matching lines is likely the one that is using RTP.
