#  In Time Movie Star Claims Gambling Victory Worth Millions!

<h3>In Time</h3>

The hit movie "In Time", starring Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried, is based on the premise that people stop aging at 25 and have one year to live. But the movie's star has claimed that her character's gambling victory in the film is worth millions of real-world dollars.

According to reports, Olivia Wilde, who plays the roles of Sylvia opposite Timberlake's Will Salas, said in an interview that her character won a "huge pot" in a casino during the course of the film. Asked how much money her character took home, Wilde replied "in the millions".

When probed further as to whether she was referring to $1 million or $10 million, Wilde became coy but did not deny that her character walked away with a huge payday. The actress' comments have stirred up excitement amongst fans of the movie, who are anxious to see just how much money Sylvia wins during her casino scene.

While there is no official confirmation as to how much money Sylvia takes from the casino, one can only assume that it is a sizable amount. The gamble features prominently in the film and culminates with a high-stakes poker game between Salas and his opponents. Given that Wilde has now confirmed her character's winnings are in the millions, it would appear that the stakes were high indeed!

#  In Time Movie Proves Winning at Gambling is Possible!

In the movie, "In Time", set in a future world where people stop aging at 25, Justin Timberlake's character finds himself on the wrong side of the law when he is accused of murder. To save himself, he agrees to go into exile for one year and live in a gated community full of gambling addicts.

Timberlake's character quickly learns that he can win at gambling if he plays the right cards. He wins large amounts of money by betting on simple games like blackjack and poker.

His success at gambling comes as a surprise to many of the other residents of the gated community, who believed that winning was impossible. Timberlake's character proves them all wrong and shows that with hard work and some luck, it is possible to win big at gambling.

#  In Time Movie Shows How to Win Gambling Every Time!

_In Time_ is a new science fiction movie starring Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried. The basic plot of the movie is that in the future people stop aging at 25 and have to earn their way to continue living by working. The rich can live forever, while the poor die young. Timberlake's character, Will Salas, discovers this injustice and decides to do something about it.

The first thing that Salas does is start gambling. He knows that if he can win enough money, he can buy himself some time. But gambling is a risky business, especially when the house always has the advantage. So how does Salas manage to win every time?

It turns out that he uses a simple trick that anyone can use. He bets on blackjack when the deck is heavily loaded in favor of the house. This may seem like a foolish move, but as long as Salas sticks to basic strategy, he can't lose. Blackjack is a game of odds and probabilities, and by betting correctly, Salas ensures that he will come out ahead in the end.

The same principle applies to other casino games such as roulette and craps. In both cases, there are certain bets that offer the player better odds than others. By making smart choices, you can tilt the odds in your favor and ensure that you come out ahead every time you gamble.

So don't be intimidated by gambling casinos! With a little bit of knowledge, you can beat them at their own game and walk away with more money than you started with.

#  How Much Did He Win in the In Time Movie? 

Time is money, as the old saying goes. In the movie "In Time" it is literally money, as people have just one year to live and must earn or steal more time in order to extend their life.  played by Justin Timberlake, finds himself on the wrong side of the equation when he's accused of murder and has a day to live. He manages to get away and goes on the run, learning more about this strange future world along the way. 

The film doesn't spend too much time exploring the hows and whys of its premise, instead focusing on Will's quest for survival. There are some currency-based montages showcasing how people barter for goods and services, but it all feels secondary to Will's fight for his own life. The ending offers up a bit more closure, but it's still fairly open-ended. So how much money does Will end up winning in the movie?

Well, that's a difficult question to answer. On the one hand, he does manage to obtain quite a bit of time over the course of the film (albeit not always legally). On the other hand, his circumstances are always precarious and he could easily lose everything at any moment. It's hard to say exactly how much he would be worth if he were to sell all of his time, but it would likely be quite a bit given that most people in the world only have a few days or weeks left to live. 

All things considered, it seems safe to say that Will wins well over ten thousand dollars in "In Time". This may not be enough to let him live forever, but it should be more than enough to keep him alive and comfortable for a long while.

#  Who Dunnit? In Time Movie Finally Answers Questions About Gambling

In the movie “In Time,” people stop aging at 25 and have one year to live unless they earn or steal more time. Gambling is a popular pastime, with games taking place in underground clubs.

The movie doesn’t answer all the questions about gambling, but it provides a few insights. For example, we learn that some games are rigged, with the house always winning. We also see that some people are able to win big – such as when Will (played by Justin Timberlake) wins a fortune at a blackjack table.

But who dunnit? That is, who is behind the rigged games and why? The answer may not be fully resolved by the end of the movie, but it seems likely that the rich and powerful are behind it all. They want to keep their hold on power and wealth, and they’re willing to do whatever it takes – including rigging games and controlling the time supply – to make sure they stay on top.
