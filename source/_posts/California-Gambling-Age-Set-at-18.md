#  California Gambling Age Set at 18

The gambling age in California is 18 years old. This is a relatively new law, as it was enacted in 2004. The purpose of this law is to protect citizens from the harmful effects of gambling.

The gambling age in California is regulated by the California Gambling Control Commission (CGCC). The CGCC is a state agency that regulates all aspects of gambling in California. The commission sets the gambling age at 18, and also regulates the games, casinos, and other gambling establishments in the state.

The commission has a number of responsibilities, including:

- Regulating the operation of casinos
- Licensing gaming employees and tribal gaming facilities
- Investigating potential violations of gambling laws
- Administering charitable gaming activities

The commission also provides educational resources on responsible gambling for both players and operators.

The gambling age in California is one of the lowest in the United States. Only two states have a lower minimum age - Nebraska and Arizona, which both have a minimum age of 17. Most states have a minimum age of 21.

Some people argue that the minimum age should be raised to 21, as this would help protect citizens from the potential harms of gambling. However, others argue that 18 is an appropriate age, as it allows young adults to participate in legal gambling activities under supervision.

Ultimately, it is up to the individual states to decide what their minimum gambling age should be.

#  You Must be 21 to Gamble in California

As of January 1, 2019, in order to gamble in the state of California you must be 21 years of age or older. This new law was enacted as a result of Proposition 6, also known as the “Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Act”. The proposition was passed by California voters in November 2018 with 58% of the vote.

The act amends the state constitution to prohibit California from allowing betting on any type of race, including horse races, dog races, and auto races. In addition, the amendment bans all forms of gambling at casinos, card clubs, and racetracks. It does allow for raffles and “participation fee” bingo games to continue to be held at nonprofits such as churches and schools.

Supporters of the proposition say that it will help create safe neighborhoods and schools by reducing crime associated with gambling. They also argue that it is important to protect children from being exposed to gambling at an early age.

Opponents of the proposition say that it will result in job losses across the state and reduce tax revenue that is used to fund public programs. They also argue that adults should be able to make their own decision about whether or not to gamble.

The new law goes into effect on January 1, 2019.

#  California Picks 21 as Gambling Age

Californians voted on Tuesday to keep the legal gambling age at 21. Proposition 21, which required a majority vote to pass, would have allowed people 18 and over to gamble in casinos, play the lottery, and bet on horse races.

The measure's defeat means that California will remain one of six states with a legal gambling age of 21. The other states are Alabama, Nebraska, Utah, Nevada, and Hawaii.

Supporters of Proposition 21 said that it would generate $1 billion in new tax revenue annually. But opponents argued that the measure would lead to more compulsive gambling and social problems.

Even if the proposition had passed, there was no guarantee that any new casinos or race tracks would have been built in California. The state's gaming industry is currently in decline, with most of the casinos located in Indian reservations.

#  California sticking with 21 as gambling age

After months of debating the issue, lawmakers in California have come to a consensus that they will not be raising the gambling age from 21. Gambling has been a part of California’s culture for many years, and lawmakers feel that it is important to keep the legal gambling age at 21 in order to protect consumer safety.

Some people argue that the legal gambling age should be raised to protect young people from developing gambling addictions at an early age. However, many lawmakers feel that it is more important to educate young people about the risks of gambling and provide resources for those who may have developed a gambling addiction.

In addition to protecting consumer safety, keeping the legal gambling age at 21 also helps to generate revenue for the state government. Taxes on gambling generate millions of dollars each year, which helps to fund important programs and services.

Ultimately, lawmakers in California feel that there are benefits to keeping the legal gambling age at 21. They will continue to work hard to make sure that consumers are protected and that revenue is generated for the state government.

#  California extends gambling age to 21

The state of California has voted to extend the legal gambling age from 18 to 21. The new law, which was passed on September 4th and will come into effect on January 1st, 2019, will apply to all forms of gambling, including casino games, lottery tickets, and sports betting.

Supporters of the bill argued that it would help protect young people from the dangers of gambling addiction, while opponents claimed that it would result in lost tax revenue for the state. Governor Jerry Brown has not yet indicated whether he will sign the bill into law.

This is not the first time that California has raised the gambling age; in 1984, the legal age was increased from 21 to 18. However, this is the first time that it has been raised across all forms of gambling.

The move comes as a number of other states are also considering increasing their gambling ages. In Nevada, for example, there is growing pressure to raise the legal age from 21 to 25.

Some experts believe that raising the gambling age could help reduce rates of problem gambling. According to a study by the University of Michigan’s Institute for Social Research, problem gambling rates are twice as high among 18-21 year olds than among those aged 22 or older.

Others argue that young people will simply find ways to gamble illegally if the legal age is raised. A report by Global Betting and Gaming Consultants (GBGC) found that more than a third of British teenagers had gambled illegally in 2016.
