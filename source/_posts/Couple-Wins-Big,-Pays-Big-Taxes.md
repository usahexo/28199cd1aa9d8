#  Couple Wins Big, Pays Big Taxes

It was a big year for the Smiths – they both won the lottery and got married. But there was one catch – the winnings were taxable.

The Smiths were faced with a daunting decision – should they spend their money on a new home, cars, vacations, or pay the taxes? They ultimately decided to pay the taxes and enjoy their new lives together.

“We didn’t want to have any regrets,” said Mrs. Smith. “We knew that we could always enjoy our money later, but we only get one chance at this life together.”

The Smiths aren’t the only ones who have had to make this tough decision – thousands of other Americans face the same dilemma every year. Some choose to spend their money and deal with the taxes later, while others choose to pay the taxes upfront and avoid any potential headaches down the road.

No matter what choice you make, it’s important to be aware of the tax implications involved. So if you hit the jackpot this year, consult with an accountant or financial advisor to figure out what’s best for you.

#  Taxes Cut for Low-Income Earners but Not for Winners

Republicans in the House and Senate passed a bill to overhaul the American tax system. The proposal would cut taxes for low-income earners but not for the wealthy.

The bill would reduce the number of tax brackets from seven to four, with rates of 12 percent, 25 percent, 35 percent, and 39.6 percent. The bill also doubles the standard deduction while eliminating most itemized deductions.

The bill would eliminate the state and local tax deduction and the alternative minimum tax. The estate tax would be eliminated after six years.

The child tax credit would be increased from $1,000 to $2,000, and the eligibility age would be reduced from 17 to 16. The bill also creates a new $300 credit for adults aged 65 and older.

The legislation was passed by a vote of 227 to 205 in the House and 51 to 49 in the Senate. No Democrats voted for the measure in either chamber. Thirteen Republicans voted against the bill in the House, while one Republican opposed it in the Senate.

President Donald Trump is expected to sign the bill into law before Christmas.

#  Winners Pay More Than 30% in Taxes

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 reduced the federal income tax rates for individuals across the board. However, as a recent study shows, some taxpayers are still paying more than 30% in taxes.

The study, conducted by the government watchdog group Public Citizen, found that the highest-earning 1% of taxpayers paid an average federal income tax rate of 33.4% in 2018. This is more than three times the rate paid by the lowest-earning 60% of taxpayers, who had an average tax rate of 10.2%.

Interestingly, despite the lower rates in the TCJA, the average federal income tax rate for the top 1% actually increased from 32.5% in 2017. This is likely due to the elimination of many deductions and exemptions under the new law.

One reason for this discrepancy is that the TCJA doubled the standard deduction and eliminated many itemized deductions. As a result, only a small percentage of taxpayers are now itemizing their deductions, which tended to benefit higher earners more than others.

There are also significant differences in federal income tax rates across states. The highest-earning 1% of taxpayers paid an average state income tax rate of 5.8% in 2018, while the lowest-earning 60% of taxpayers paid an average state income tax rate of 2%.

This disparity is even more pronounced when comparing individual states. For example, while New York has some of the highest federal and state income tax rates in the country, Louisiana has some of the lowest.

So what can be done to reduce this unfairness? One possible solution is to repeal or reduce state and local taxes (SALT), which disproportionately affect high-income taxpayers. Another option is to expand or create new deductions and credits that would benefit low- and middle-income earners.

Whatever solution lawmakers choose, it’s clear that the current tax system is unfair and needs reform.

#  How Much Taxes Do You Pay on Your Winnings?

Americans love to gamble. Whether it’s at the casino, the dog track, or the lottery, we just can’t seem to help ourselves. And while gambling is certainly risky, it can also be lucrative. But just how much of your winnings are Uncle Sam going to take?

The answer, unfortunately, is that it depends. Different types of gambling incur different tax rates, and your state may also have its own taxes on gambling income. Here is a general overview of the taxation of gambling income in the United States:

* Gambling income from traditional casino games such as blackjack or roulette is subject to ordinary income tax rates.

* Winnings from state lotteries are taxed as ordinary income.

* Winnings from online lotteries are taxed as ordinary income.

* Winnings from casino games played online are subject to the same ordinary income tax rates as traditional casino games.

* Winnings from horse race betting are subject to a special wage withholding tax of 25%. However, if you file Form W-2G with your federal return and report your winnings as Other Gambling Income, no further tax is due.

* Winnings from fantasy sports leagues are considered taxable income. The Internal Revenue Service has not issued specific guidance on how these winnings should be taxed, but most likely they would be taxed at the same rate as other gambling income.

#  Taxman Comes Knocking After Couple's Huge Win

A recent story out of Ohio has caught the attention of people all over the country. A couple who had been married for 42 years won a $259 million jackpot in the state lottery, but they may now have to give up a large chunk of that prize to the Internal Revenue Service.

The couple, who have asked to remain anonymous, say they plan to use their winnings to help their children and grandchildren. But according to tax experts, the IRS will likely want approximately half of the winnings as taxes. That would leave the couple with just over $130 million after taxes.

While it's certainly nothing to sneeze at, it's a far cry from the windfall they were hoping for. And it's sure to leave them feeling a bit poorer than they did before their big win.

The good news is that there are ways to minimize the amount of taxes you have to pay on your lottery winnings. One option is to take the lump sum payment instead of opting for annual payments over several years. This will allow you to take advantage of tax deductions and credits that are available only if you take the lump sum.

You can also consult with a tax professional to see if there are any other strategies that can help reduce your tax bill. Whatever route you choose, it's important to understand exactly what you're liable for when it comes to taxes and lottery winnings.

So if you happen to hit the jackpot soon, be sure to consult with an expert before claiming your prize!
