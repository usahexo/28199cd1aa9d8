Gambling addiction is really a concern that is certainly frequently dismissed or maybe underplayed. It inflicts significant damage on both the gambler and people around them, however it might be treated. Compulsive playing is an ailment that falls under the classification of impulse-control conditions. This means the person has difficulty resisting urges or impulses to perform certain activities, even though they realize that these behaviors are bad for them.

In Virginia, betting on sports is legalized and there are indications it really is growing in appeal. That's why it's important to understand the warning signs of gambling addiction and also to know how to get assistance if you or someone you like may be struggling with this particular condition.

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), categorizes gambling addiction as an impulse-control disorder. Individuals who gamble compulsively can become so hooked on the rush or excitement of betting that it becomes difficult or impossible for them to stop. They will often gamble despite serious negative consequences such as job loss, financial ruin, and relationship problems.

Gambling addiction is not just a problem for the person with the addiction. Family members and friends also suffer greatly from this condition. They typically bear the brunt of financial devastation caused by compulsive gambling, and they often have to deal with the emotional fallout when relationships fray because of gambling debts and issues.
