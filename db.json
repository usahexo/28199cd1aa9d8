are the 8 best photo sharing websites","date":"2022-08-17T11:37:08.000Z","_content":"\n\n#  What are the 8 best photo sharing websites?\n\nWhen it comes to sharing pictures online, there are a lot of different options to choose from. Depending on your needs, some photo sharing websites might work better for you than others. So, what are the 8 best photo sharing websites?\n\n1. Flickr: Flickr is one of the most well-known and popular photo sharing websites. It offers a lot of features, including the ability to add tags and descriptions to your photos, as well as to easily browse through other people’s photos.\n\n2. Facebook: Facebook is another hugely popular website that allows you to share photos with your friends. You can create albums and add descriptions and tags, and your friends can comment on your photos.\n\n3. Google Photos: Google Photos is a newer addition to the world of photo sharing websites, but it’s already very popular. It offers unlimited storage for your photos, and makes it easy to search for specific photos or albums.\n\n4. Instagram: Instagram is most famous for its filters that allow you to quickly and easily make your photos look more professional. But it also offers other features, such as the ability to follow other users and share your photos with them.\n\n5. Picasa: Picasa is Google’s photo sharing website. It’s not as popular as some of the other options on this list, but it does offer some unique features, such as the ability to create movies from your photos.\n\n6. SmugMug: SmugMug is a more expensive option than some of the others on this list, but it offers a lot of features that other websites don’t have, such as the ability to print your photos directly from the website.\n\n7. Snapfish: Snapfish is another affordable option for photo sharing, and it offers a number of different features, such as the ability to order prints of your photos directly from the website.\n\n8. Tumblr: Tumblr is a social media platform that primarily focuses on blogging, but it also allows you to share photos with your followers. You can create separate blogs for each set of photos, or simply post them all in one place.\n\n#  Why should you take more of your photos on these websites?\n\nThe world is filled with websites that offer photo-sharing capabilities, but not all of them are created equal. Some websites are better than others when it comes to taking and sharing your photos. Here are three reasons why you should take more of your photos on these websites:\n\n1. Better organization and storage options\n\nMany of the photo-sharing websites out there offer great organizational tools. You can easily create albums and folders to store your photos in, making it easy to find the ones you want. In addition, most of these websites offer generous storage allowances, meaning you can keep all of your photos in one place without having to worry about running out of space.\n\n2. More features for editing and enhancing your photos\n\nMost of the major photo-sharing websites offer a wide range of features for editing and enhancing your photos. This includes everything from basic tools like cropping and rotating to more advanced features like adding filters and effects. With so many options available, you can easily make your photos look their best before sharing them with the world.\n\n3. A larger community of photographers to connect with\n\nFinally, another great reason to take more of your photos on these websites is because they have a large community of photographers who can provide valuable feedback and support. Whether you’re looking for advice on how to improve your photography skills or just need someone to share your latest photo with, these websites are a great place to start.\n\n#  What are the benefits of using photo sharing websites?\n\nThere are a number of benefits to using photo sharing websites. First and foremost, these websites make it easy for you to share your photos with friends and family. In addition, many of these websites offer features that allow you to edit your photos, add filters, and create slideshows. Finally, photo sharing websites can help you to organize your photos and keep them safe online.\n\n#  How can you make the most out of photo sharing websites?\n\nAlmost everyone has a camera phone and with the advancements in technology, the quality of photos that are taken are only getting better. So, what do you do with all of these great photos? You could print them out and put them in an album, but what if you want to share them with your friends and family?\n\nThere are a number of different photo sharing websites that you can use. Some of the most popular ones include Flickr, Instagram, and Pinterest. Each website has its own set of features, so it’s important to choose one that will best meet your needs.\n\nIf you’re looking for a website that is easy to use and allows you to share your photos with a large audience, then Flickr is the best option. Flickr allows users to upload photos up to 200MB in size, which is more than enough for most people. You can also add tags and descriptions to your photos, which makes them easier to find later on.\n\nIf you’re looking for a website that is mainly focused on photo sharing, then Instagram is the best option. Instagram allows users to upload photos up to 1GB in size, which is more than enough for high quality photos. In addition, Instagram offers a wide range of filters and editing tools that can be used to improve your photos.\n\nIf you’re looking for a website that allows you to pin your favorite photos onto virtual boards, then Pinterest is the best option. Pinterest offers a wide range of different boards that you can use, which makes it perfect for grouping related photos together. In addition, Pinterest offers a number of different ways to share your boards with others.\n\n#  What are some things to keep in mind when using photo sharing websites?\n\nThere are a few things to keep in mind when using photo sharing websites. The first is to be aware of the terms of service of the website. Some websites prohibit the use of their images for commercial purposes. Others prohibit the use of images in ways that may violate copyright laws.\n\nAnother thing to be aware of is the privacy settings of each website. Many photo sharing websites allow users to share their photos with only specific people, or to make them public. It is important to be aware of these settings before uploading photos, as they can often be changed after the photos have been uploaded.\n\nFinally, it is important to remember that photo sharing websites are intended for sharing photos, not for storing them. Photos that are not actively being shared may be removed from the website if they take up too much space on the server.","source":"_posts/What-are-the-8-best-photo-sharing-websites.md","raw":"---\ntitle: What are the 8 best photo sharing websites\ndate: 2022-08-17 19:37:08\ncategories:\n- Photo\ntags:\n---\n\n\n#  What are the 8 best photo sharing websites?\n\nWhen it comes to sharing pictures online, there are a lot of different options to choose from.

You could print them out and put them in an album, but what if you want to share them with your friends and family?\n\nThere are a number of different photo sharing websites that you can use. Some of the most popular ones include Flickr, Instagram, and Pinterest. Each website has its own set of features, so it’s important to choose one that will best meet your needs.\n\nIf you’re looking for a website that is easy to use and allows you to share your photos with a large audience, then Flickr is the best option.

Instagram allows users to upload photos up to 1GB in size, which is more than enough for high quality photos. In addition, Instagram offers a wide range of filters and editing tools that can be used to improve your photos.\n\nIf you’re looking for a website that allows you to pin your favorite photos onto virtual boards, then Pinterest is the best option. Pinterest offers a wide range of different boards that you can use, which makes it perfect for grouping related photos together. In addition, Pinterest offers a number of different ways to share your boards with others.\n\n#  What are some things to keep in mind when using photo sharing websites?\n\nThere are a few things to keep in mind when using photo sharing websites. The first is to be aware of the terms of service of the website. Some websites prohibit the use of their images for commercial purposes. Others prohibit the use of images in ways that may violate copyright laws.\n\nAnother thing to be aware of is the privacy settings of each website. Many photo sharing websites allow users to share their photos with only specific people, or to make them public. It is important to be aware of these settings before uploading photos, as they can often be changed after the photos have been uploaded.\n\nFinally, it is important to remember that photo sharing websites are intended for sharing photos, not for storing them. Photos that are not actively being shared may be removed from the website if they take up too much space on the server.","slug":"What-are-the-8-best-photo-sharing-websites","published":1,"updated":"2022-08-17T11:37:08.315Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cl6xjh0b10001ggv5feswdslh","content":"<h1 id=\"What-are-the-8-best-photo-sharing-websites\"><a href=\"#What-are-the-8-best-photo-sharing-websites\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"What are the 8 best photo sharing websites?\"></a>What are the 8 best photo sharing websites?</h1><p>When it comes to sharing pictures online, there are a lot of different options to choose from.

Some may find the process of taking a photograph to be therapeutic, while others may enjoy the challenge of capturing a perfect moment. Whatever the reason, photography has the ability to inspire and move people in ways other art forms cannot.\n\nOne of the things that makes photography so unique is its ability to freeze time. By capturing an image, an artist can share a moment with others that they would have otherwise missed. This can be especially powerful when it comes to documenting historic events or everyday life.\n\nPhotography can also be incredibly beautiful. There is something about seeing a photograph that evokes emotion in people, whether it’s happiness, sadness, anger or love. Photographs can take us on a journey to far-off places or make us feel like we’ve been transported back in time. They can make us see the world in a new way and remind us of how precious life is.\n\nIn the hands of a skilled artist, photography can be a tool for storytelling and communication. By sharing their photographs, artists can create connections with others and help them see the world in a different light. Photography has the power to change people’s perceptions and inspire them to do great things.\n\n#  How has photography changed over the years?\n\nThe history of photography is rich and varied, with many different styles and techniques emerging over the years. While photography has always been used to capture memories and moments, its role has changed significantly over time.\n\nIn the early days of photography, the process was slow and cumbersome. It could take hours to capture a single photo. This meant that photography was mainly used for documenting events or important historical moments.\n\nWith the advent of digital technology, photography has become much more accessible and faster to produce. This has led to a proliferation of photo sharing online, with people capturing every moment of their lives and sharing them on social media.\n\nIn recent years, there has also been a trend towards more creative and experimental forms of photography. This includes using alternative methods such as light painting or creating photos using mixed media.\n\nOverall, photography has come a long way since it was first invented in 1839. It is now widely used for capturing memories, telling stories and making art.\n\n#  What is the difference between a good and bad photograph?\n\nThis is a question that has been asked by photographers and photo enthusiasts for years. What makes a good photograph? Is it the composition? The lighting? The subject matter? While all of these elements certainly contribute to the make-up of a good photograph, there is one overarching factor that trumps them all – emotion.\n\nA good photograph is not simply a record of what was photographed, but rather, it is an image that stirs an emotion in the viewer. It might make them happy, sad, angry, nostalgic, or any number of other emotions. But if it doesn’t evoke an emotional response in some way, then it’s likely not a very good photograph.\n\nThis is not to say that technical aspects of photography are unimportant. Quite the contrary – having a strong technical foundation is essential for creating photographs that evoke emotion. However, if your photos are technically perfect but they don’t move people on an emotional level, then they are likely forgettable.\n\nEmotion is what sets great photos apart from mediocre ones, and it’s what makes people want to look at them time and time again. So if you want to take your photography to the next level, focus on evoking emotion in your images. And don’t be afraid to experiment – there is no single recipe for creating emotionally powerful photos.\n\n#  Who decides what is art and what is not?\n\nFor centuries, the question of what is and is not art has been debated by both experts and laypeople alike. While some might argue that there is a definitive answer to this question, others believe that it is a matter of personal opinion. What all parties seem to agree on, however, is that the definition of art is not always clear-cut. In many cases, it is up to the individual to decide what they consider to be art.\n\nOne of the reasons why the definition of art is so difficult to nail down is because it can encompass a wide range of mediums and disciplines. Some might consider a painting by Vincent van Gogh to be artwork, while others might disagree and say that only certain types of art are worthy of this label. Similarly, some people might deem a piece of furniture to be an example of art, while others might see it as a functional object.\n\nSo, who gets to decide what is and is not art? In most cases, it is up to the artist themselves to determine how their work should be classified. They may choose to call their creation an artwork, or they may refer to it as something else altogether. Ultimately, it is up to the individual to decide what they want their work to be called.\n\nThere are also times when the general public gets to weigh in on what constitutes as art. This tends to happen when there is disagreement among experts about whether or not a particular work should be considered art. In these situations, the general public often has the final say in whether or not something counts as an artwork.\n\nAs you can see, there are many different factors that go into determining what qualifies as art. It can be a complex topic with no easy answers. Ultimately, it is up to each individual person to decide for themselves what they believe constitutes as an artwork.","source":"_posts/What-is-'photography'.md","raw":"---\ntitle: What is 'photography'\ndate: 2022-09-20 18:43:42\ncategories:\n- Photography\ntags:\n- Photo\n- Photograph\n- Photography\n---\n\n\n#  What is 'photography'?\n\nThere is no one, definitive answer to this question.\n\nBut at its simplest, photography is the art and science of capturing light on a photosensitive surface (such as film or a digital sensor) to create an image.\n\nLight can be captured in a number of ways - with a camera obscura, for example, or with a simple pinhole camera.\n\nAnd while photography has been around for centuries, the digital age has brought about new ways of capturing and manipulating images.\n\n#  What inspires artists to create photography?\n\nThere are many reasons why artists are drawn to photography.

The odds vary depending on which bet you make, but typically pay out at 2-1 or 3-1 if they come in.\n\nThe most important thing to understand when playing European roulette is the house edge. This is the percentage of each bet that the casino takes as profit. In European roulette, the house edge is 2.7%. This means that for every $100 you bet, the casino will keep $2.70 as profit. While this may not seem like a lot, it can add up over time. It’s important to factor this into your betting strategy if you want to have any hope of winning in the long run!\n\n# What are the rules of European Roulette?\n\nEuropean Roulette is a casino game where players bet on the outcome of a spinning wheel. The game uses a single, zero-spaced numbered wheel and bets are placed on either individual numbers or groups of numbers. Winning bets are paid out at odds based on the player's initial bet.\n\nThe object of the game is to correctly predict where the ball will come to rest on the wheel after it has spun. Players can bet on a single number, or they can bet on any range of numbers by placing their chips in one of the boxes surrounding the table layout.\n\nThere are a total of 37 pockets on the roulette wheel - 18 red, 18 black and one green. The ball will come to rest in one of these pockets, and players who have bet on that number will win their stake multiplied by 35:1. If players have placed a bet on two different numbers, and the ball comes to rest between them, they will receive a payout equivalent to 17:1.\n\nBets can also be placed on odds or evens, red or black, or high (19-36) or low (1-18) numbers. This type of bet pays out at 1:1 if the ball lands on the chosen number, or if it is within the selected range.\n\n# What are the odds in European Roulette?\n\nEuropean Roulette is a popular casino game that uses a wheel with 36 numbered slots and a ball. Players can bet on a range of different outcomes, including the number the ball will land on, whether the number will be odd or even, and colour. The odds of each bet depend on the likelihood of that particular outcome happening.\n\n# Bets on individual numbers\n\nThe odds of winning a bet on an individual number are 1 in 36. This means that if you bet £1 on any one number and the ball lands on that number, you will win £36 plus your original stake back. If you bet £10 on any one number and the ball lands on that number, you will win £360 plus your original stake back.\n\nHowever, betting on an individual number is also the riskiest bet you can make in European Roulette. If you bet £1 on red and the ball lands on black, you will lose your entire stake.\n\n# Odds of winning bets other than individual numbers\n\nOdds of winning other than individual numbers depend on the type of bet you are making. Here are some examples:\n\nEven money bets - These are bets where the odds of winning are 1:1, such as bets on red or black, odd or even, and 1-18 or 19-36. This type of bet pays out exactly what you wagered if you win.\n\n- These are bets where the odds of winning are 1:1, such as bets on red or black, odd or even, and 1-18 or 19-36.

This type of bet pays out twice your original stake if you win. 3:1 bets - These are bets where the odds of winning are 3:1, such as betting on a specific row.

The Spurs compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the league's Western Conference Southwest Division. The team plays its home games at the AT&T Center in San Antonio.\n\nThe Spurs are one of four former American Basketball Association teams to remain intact in the NBA after the ABA–NBA merger (the others being the Portland Trail Blazers, Denver Nuggets, and Indiana Pacers).\n\nThe franchise was formed as the Dallas Chaparrals of the original American Basketball Association (ABA) in 1967. In 1971, they moved to San Antonio and became the Spurs.\n\nThe Spurs have won five NBA championships (1999, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2014). They are also one of only three franchises to have never been eliminated in the first round of the playoffs. With their 50th win in the 2013–14 season, they extended their record for most consecutive winning seasons to 18.\n\n# Origins of the San Antonio Spurs\n\nThe Dallas Chaparrals were one of two NBA expansion franchises that began play with the 1967–68 season. The Cincinnati Royals were founded as an expansion team two years earlier but suspended operations for three seasons after playing only two games because of financial problems.[4] The Spurs were part of a wave of ABA teams that merged with their NBA counterparts starting with the 1976–77 season. The ABA Spurs competed in what was then called division A while their NBA counterparts competed in division C. As a result, both teams played each other twice during the 1976–77 season; once at home and once on the road. At that time, division winners advanced to a best-of-three playoff series while second-place finishers played each other for another berth in the series. Because both teams finished with identical win-loss records at .500, a coin flip was used to determine who would advance.[5] The Spurs lost game 1 at home 111–103 but won game 2 on the road 114–105 and game 3 at home 127–118 to advance.[6] As a result of their victory over Dallas, they became one of four former American Basketball Association teams (the others being Portland Trail Blazers, Denver Nuggets, and Indiana Pacers) to remain intact after the ABA–NBA merger which resulted in four new divisions being created (two within each conference). This is why until recently they have always worn So blue and silver uniforms since joining forces with dallas mavericks When they moved from San Antonio they becameDallas spurs\n\n#  Where is the San Antonio Spurs located?\n\nThe San Antonio Spurs are located in San Antonio, Texas.\n\n#  What is the history of the San Antonio Spurs?\n\nThe San Antonio Spurs are a professional basketball team based in San Antonio, Texas. The Spurs compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the league's Western Conference Southwest Division. The team plays its home games at the AT&T Center in San Antonio.\n\nThe franchise was founded on April 4, 1967, as the Dallas Chaparrals of the American Basketball Association (ABA). In 1971, the team relocated to San Antonio and became the San Antonio Spurs. The Spurs have won five NBA championships (1999, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2014).\n\nAs of 2019, the Spurs are the second most successful team in NBA history in terms of championships won. They are also one of only four teams in NBA history to have won five or more championships\n\nThe Spurs began play in 1967 as the Dallas Chaparrals of the upstart ABA. The team did not fare well on the court, winning only 29 games during their inaugural season. However, they were one of the most entertaining teams in the league thanks to players like George Gervin and James Silas. The Chaparrals eventually moved to San Antonio and became known as the Spurs in 1973.\n\nThe early years in San Antonio were difficult for the Spurs. They failed to make the playoffs from 1974-77 and only had one winning season during that time.

The Cincinnati Royals were founded as an expansion team two years earlier but suspended operations for three seasons after playing only two games because of financial problems.[4] The Spurs were part of a wave of ABA teams that merged with their NBA counterparts starting with the 1976–77 season. The ABA Spurs competed in what was then called division A while their NBA counterparts competed in division C. As a result, both teams played each other twice during the 1976–77 season; once at home and once on the road. At that time, division winners advanced to a best-of-three playoff series while second-place finishers played each other for another berth in the series. Because both teams finished with identical win-loss records at .500, a coin flip was used to determine who would advance.[5] The Spurs lost game 1 at home 111–103 but won game 2 on the road 114–105 and game 3 at home 127–118 to advance.[6] As a result of their victory over Dallas, they became one of four former American Basketball Association teams (the others being Portland Trail Blazers, Denver Nuggets, and Indiana Pacers) to remain intact after the ABA–NBA merger which resulted in four new divisions being created (two within each conference).

Players can buy a box for a set price and then receive a random prize. The most common prizes are small amounts of money, but some players have won cars, vacations, and even houses.\n\nSo how much do casino owners make from the game? The answer may surprise you.\n\nCasino owners earn a percentage of each box sold. For example, if a box costs $10 and the casino owner earns 10% of each sale, they would earn $1 per box sold. This may not seem like much, but when you consider how many boxes are sold each year, it quickly adds up.\n\nIn fact, the total amount earned by casino owners from lucky boxes is estimated to be in the tens of millions of dollars. This is a big chunk of change and it's no wonder casino owners are eager to promote this game to their players.\n\nSo if you're feeling lucky, be sure to get your hands on a lucky box! You could be the next winner!\n\n#  How Much Money Does the Casino Owner Make from the Lottery?\n\nLotteries have been around for centuries, with various government entities using them as a way to generate revenue. But how much money does the casino owner actually make from the lottery?\n\nIt’s difficult to say for certain, as lotteries vary in size and scope from country to country. In the United States, for example, state lotteries generated more than $18 billion in revenue in 2017. This number is dwarfed by China’s state-run lottery, which generated an incredible $87 billion in revenue the same year.\n\nHowever, if we look at smaller lotteries – those with jackpots of less than $1 million – we can get a general idea of how much money the casino owner makes from the lottery. In these lotteries, the casino owner typically takes a percentage of each ticket sold as their commission. For example, in the United Kingdom, the casino owner typically takes a commission of 25%. This means that for every £4 ticket sold, the casino owner takes £1 and leaves £3 for the prize pool.\n\nThis commission percentage varies depending on the country, but it’s generally in this ballpark. So, if we take China’s state-run lottery as an example again, and assume that they take a commission of 25%, this would mean that for every 100 yuan (approximately $14 USD) ticket sold, the casino owner would take 25 yuan (approximately $3.50 USD) and leave 75 yuan (approximately $10.50 USD) for the prize pool.\n\nSo, how much money does the casino owner make from the lottery? Generally speaking, they take between 20% and 30% of each ticket sold. This means that for every million dollars generated by a lottery, between 200 thousand and 300 thousand dollars goes into the casino owner’s pocket.\n\n#  How Much do Casino Owners Make from the Lottery?\n\nLottery players want to know how much money the casino owners make from the lottery. The answer, unfortunately, is not a simple one.\n\nThere are a number of different ways to operate a lottery, and the profits that the casino owner can make vary depending on the type of lottery that is being played. In some cases, the casino owner may only take a percentage of each ticket sold as their profits. In other cases, the casino owner may be given a set prize for each winning ticket. This means that they do not make any money from players who do not win the jackpot.\n\nSome states have lotteries that are run by the government, while other states have private companies running their lotteries. The profits that the casino owner makes from these lotteries also varies depending on where you live. For example, in New Hampshire, where a private company operates the state's lottery, the casino owner takes in around $27 million in revenue every year. However, in Georgia, where the state lottery is run by the government, the casino owner only makes around $5 million each year from ticket sales.\n\nSo, how much money does the average casino owner make from running a lottery? Unfortunately, there is no definitive answer to this question. It depends on a number of factors, including the type of lottery being played and which state it is being operated in. However, it is safe to say that casino owners generally make a considerable amount of money from running lotteries.\n\n#  How Much Does the Casino Win from the Lottery?\n\nThere is a perception that the casino is the big winner in the lottery, and in many ways this is true. However, the amount that the casino wins from the lottery varies depending on how it is run.\n\nIn some states, like Illinois, the casino does not get to keep any of the proceeds from the lottery. This is because those states use the money to fund state programs like education. In other states, like Delaware, the casino gets to keep a portion of the money. This portion varies depending on how much money is generated from ticket sales.\n\nSo, how much does the casino actually win from the lottery?

Players can buy a box for a set price and then receive a random prize. The most common prizes are small amounts of money, but some players have won cars, vacations, and even houses.\n\nSo how much do casino owners make from the game? The answer may surprise you.\n\nCasino owners earn a percentage of each box sold. For example, if a box costs $10 and the casino owner earns 10% of each sale, they would earn $1 per box sold. This may not seem like much, but when you consider how many boxes are sold each year, it quickly adds up.\n\nIn fact, the total amount earned by casino owners from lucky boxes is estimated to be in the tens of millions of dollars. This is a big chunk of change and it's no wonder casino owners are eager to promote this game to their players.\n\nSo if you're feeling lucky, be sure to get your hands on a lucky box! You could be the next winner!\n\n#  How Much Money Does the Casino Owner Make from the Lottery?\n\nLotteries have been around for centuries, with various government entities using them as a way to generate revenue. But how much money does the casino owner actually make from the lottery?\n\nIt’s difficult to say for certain, as lotteries vary in size and scope from country to country. In the United States, for example, state lotteries generated more than $18 billion in revenue in 2017. This number is dwarfed by China’s state-run lottery, which generated an incredible $87 billion in revenue the same year.\n\nHowever, if we look at smaller lotteries – those with jackpots of less than $1 million – we can get a general idea of how much money the casino owner makes from the lottery. In these lotteries, the casino owner typically takes a percentage of each ticket sold as their commission. For example, in the United Kingdom, the casino owner typically takes a commission of 25%. This means that for every £4 ticket sold, the casino owner takes £1 and leaves £3 for the prize pool.\n\nThis commission percentage varies depending on the country, but it’s generally in this ballpark. So, if we take China’s state-run lottery as an example again, and assume that they take a commission of 25%, this would mean that for every 100 yuan (approximately $14 USD) ticket sold, the casino owner would take 25 yuan (approximately $3.50 USD) and leave 75 yuan (approximately $10.50 USD) for the prize pool.\n\nSo, how much money does the casino owner make from the lottery? Generally speaking, they take between 20% and 30% of each ticket sold. This means that for every million dollars generated by a lottery, between 200 thousand and 300 thousand dollars goes into the casino owner’s pocket.\n\n#  How Much do Casino Owners Make from the Lottery?\n\nLottery players want to know how much money the casino owners make from the lottery. The answer, unfortunately, is not a simple one.\n\nThere are a number of different ways to operate a lottery, and the profits that the casino owner can make vary depending on the type of lottery that is being played. In some cases, the casino owner may only take a percentage of each ticket sold as their profits. In other cases, the casino owner may be given a set prize for each winning ticket. This means that they do not make any money from players who do not win the jackpot.\n\nSome states have lotteries that are run by the government, while other states have private companies running their lotteries. The profits that the casino owner makes from these lotteries also varies depending on where you live. For example, in New Hampshire, where a private company operates the state's lottery, the casino owner takes in around $27 million in revenue every year. However, in Georgia, where the state lottery is run by the government, the casino owner only makes around $5 million each year from ticket sales.\n\nSo, how much money does the average casino owner make from running a lottery? Unfortunately, there is no definitive answer to this question. It depends on a number of factors, including the type of lottery being played and which state it is being operated in. However, it is safe to say that casino owners generally make a considerable amount of money from running lotteries.\n\n#  How Much Does the Casino Win from the Lottery?\n\nThere is a perception that the casino is the big winner in the lottery, and in many ways this is true. However, the amount that the casino wins from the lottery varies depending on how it is run.\n\nIn some states, like Illinois, the casino does not get to keep any of the proceeds from the lottery. This is because those states use the money to fund state programs like education. In other states, like Delaware, the casino gets to keep a portion of the money. This portion varies depending on how much money is generated from ticket sales.\n\nSo, how much does the casino actually win from the lottery? In short, it depends on where you live.\n\n#  What is the Prize Pool for the Casino's Lucky Boxes Game?\n\nThe prize pool for the Casino's Lucky Boxes game is usually a few hundred thousand dollars. However, on occasion, the prize pool can be as high as 1 million dollars. This makes the game quite attractive to casino players, as there is a good chance of winning a large sum of money.\n\nTo participate in the Lucky Boxes game, players must purchase a box for $1.00.

The spinning wheel and the anticipation of where the ball will land is always exciting. And when you finally do win, it feels even better.\n\nBut what do you do when it's time to cash out? Do you go to the casino in person? Do you request a check in the mail? Or do you use an online roulette payout service?\n\nEach of these options has its own set of pros and cons, so it can be tough to decide which is best for you. In this article, we'll take a look at each of them and help you decide which is right for you.\n\nCashing Out at the Casino In Person\n\nIf you're close to a casino, cashing out in person might be your best option. You'll be able to get your money immediately, and you won't have to worry about any fees or delays. However, casinos are often busy places, so there's no guarantee that there will be enough staff on hand to process your payout quickly. And if there are delays, you could be waiting for hours before getting your money.\n\nAnother downside to cashing out in person is that casinos often charge fees for payouts. These fees can range from a few dollars up to 10% of your payout amount, so they can really eat into your profits.\n\nCashing Out by Check in the Mail\n\nIf you don't want to deal with crowds or fees, cashing out by check might be a good option for you. This method typically doesn't involve any fees, and most casinos send checks out within a few days of receiving your payout request. However, there are a few things to keep in mind when using this method:\n\n- Checks can take several days or even weeks to arrive, depending on where you live. So if you need your money immediately, this might not be the best option.\n- Not all casinos offer check payouts. Make sure that the casino where you won supports this payout method before requesting it.\n- Some banks will charge extra fees for depositing checks from gambling establishments into your account. So make sure that you're aware of these potential charges before requesting a payout by check.\n\n#  Guaranteed Ways to Get Your Casino Roulette Payouts\n\nThere are certain things you can do to guarantee you get the casino roulette payouts you deserve. Here are some tips to follow:\n\n1. Know the odds. This is probably the most important thing to do when playing roulette. If you know what your chances of winning are, then you can make better decisions about when to bet and how much to bet.\n\n2. Don't bet on black or red. The odds of winning when betting on black or red are only 50/50, so it's not the best option if you're looking for a high payout.\n\n3. Bet on specific numbers. This will give you a better chance of winning, as the odds of hitting the right number are much higher than betting on black or red.\n\n4. Stick to a budget. Roulette can be a very expensive game, so make sure you don't bet more than you can afford to lose.\n\n5. Take advantage of bonuses and promotions. Many online casinos offer generous bonuses and promotions, so make sure you take advantage of them!\n\n#  Tips for Collecting Your Casino Roulette Payouts Quickly\n\nCasino roulette is a popular game that can often result in sizable payouts. If you're lucky enough to win, it's important to collect your money quickly so you can enjoy your spoils. Here are some tips for ensuring a smooth payout process:\n\n**1. Know the procedures for collecting your winnings.** Most casinos have a standard payout procedure that includes providing identification and filling out a form. Make sure you know what this procedure entails before playing so you're not caught off guard when it's time to collect your winnings.\n\n**2. Bring identification with you to the casino.** Many casinos require players to provide identification before issuing payouts, so make sure you have your driver's license or other form of identification ready when it's time to collect your money.\n\n**3. Have the correct amount of cash ready.** When collecting your winnings, be prepared with the correct amount of cash. Casinos typically don't issue checks or other forms of payment on-site, so be sure to have enough cash on hand to cover your payout.\n\n4. Be patient and polite when collecting your money.** Although it may be tempting to rush through the payout process, it's important to be patient and polite when interacting with casino personnel. This will ensure a smooth payout experience and help maintain good relationships with the casino staff.\n\n#  How to Avoid Issues When Cashing Out Your Casino Roulette Winnings\n\nWhen you hit a big win while playing casino roulette, the temptation can be strong to take the money and run. However, if you're not careful, you could end up facing some serious financial problems. To avoid any issues when cashing out your casino roulette winnings, follow these simple tips.\n\nFirst, always make sure that you have a clear understanding of the casino's terms and conditions regarding withdrawals. Some casinos have minimum withdrawal amounts, so be sure to factor that into your plans. Additionally, some casinos may impose restrictions on how you can use your winnings. For example, they may require that you withdraw the money in one lump sum or split it into several smaller withdrawals.\n\nNext, be sure to keep track of how much money you're spending and where it's going. It can be easy to lose track of your spending when you suddenly have a lot of extra cash in your wallet. Just because you won big at the casino doesn't mean that you should splurge on unnecessary items. Stick to your budget and remember that Roulette is a game of chance – don’t blow all your winnings in one go!\n\nFinally, make sure that you take steps to protect your winnings. Store them in a safe place such as a bank or investment account, and avoid spending them on anything until you've had a chance to think things through. This will help ensure that you don't run into any problems down the road.\n\nBy following these simple tips, you can avoid any issues when cashing out your casino roulette winnings. So go ahead and enjoy your victory – just be smart about it!\n\n#  What You Need to Know About Collecting Casino Roulette Payouts\n\nCasino Roulette comes with a number of payouts that players can collect based on the bet they place. In order to better understand the various payout opportunities available, it is important to know what each one entails.\n\nThe following are some of the most common casino roulette payouts:\n\n#1: Straight Up Bet – A bet placed on a single number pays out 35-1.\n\n#2: Split Bet – A bet placed on two adjacent numbers pays out 17-1.\n\n#3: Street Bet – A bet placed on three consecutive numbers pays out 11-1.\n\n#4: Corner Bet – A bet placed on four adjacent numbers pays out 8-1.\n\n#5: Six Line Bet – A bet placed on six consecutive numbers pays out 5-1.","source":"_posts/How-to-Cash-Out-Chumban-Online-Casino-Roulette-Payouts.md","raw":"---\ntitle: How to Cash Out Chumban Online Casino Roulette Payouts\ndate: 2022-10-07 17:38:35\ncategories:\n- online casino\ntags:\n---\n\n\n#  How to Cash Out Chumban Online Casino Roulette Payouts\n\nThe thrill of roulette is one that never seems to die, no matter how many times you play.

However, if you're not careful, you could end up facing some serious financial problems. To avoid any issues when cashing out your casino roulette winnings, follow these simple tips.\n\nFirst, always make sure that you have a clear understanding of the casino's terms and conditions regarding withdrawals. Some casinos have minimum withdrawal amounts, so be sure to factor that into your plans. Additionally, some casinos may impose restrictions on how you can use your winnings. For example, they may require that you withdraw the money in one lump sum or split it into several smaller withdrawals.\n\nNext, be sure to keep track of how much money you're spending and where it's going. It can be easy to lose track of your spending when you suddenly have a lot of extra cash in your wallet. Just because you won big at the casino doesn't mean that you should splurge on unnecessary items. Stick to your budget and remember that Roulette is a game of chance – don’t blow all your winnings in one go!\n\nFinally, make sure that you take steps to protect your winnings. Store them in a safe place such as a bank or investment account, and avoid spending them on anything until you've had a chance to think things through. This will help ensure that you don't run into any problems down the road.\n\nBy following these simple tips, you can avoid any issues when cashing out your casino roulette winnings.

This is a relatively new law, as it was enacted in 2004. The purpose of this law is to protect citizens from the harmful effects of gambling.\n\nThe gambling age in California is regulated by the California Gambling Control Commission (CGCC). The CGCC is a state agency that regulates all aspects of gambling in California. The commission sets the gambling age at 18, and also regulates the games, casinos, and other gambling establishments in the state.\n\nThe commission has a number of responsibilities, including:\n\n- Regulating the operation of casinos\n- Licensing gaming employees and tribal gaming facilities\n- Investigating potential violations of gambling laws\n- Administering charitable gaming activities\n\nThe commission also provides educational resources on responsible gambling for both players and operators.\n\nThe gambling age in California is one of the lowest in the United States. Only two states have a lower minimum age - Nebraska and Arizona, which both have a minimum age of 17. Most states have a minimum age of 21.\n\nSome people argue that the minimum age should be raised to 21, as this would help protect citizens from the potential harms of gambling. However, others argue that 18 is an appropriate age, as it allows young adults to participate in legal gambling activities under supervision.\n\nUltimately, it is up to the individual states to decide what their minimum gambling age should be.\n\n#  You Must be 21 to Gamble in California\n\nAs of January 1, 2019, in order to gamble in the state of California you must be 21 years of age or older. This new law was enacted as a result of Proposition 6, also known as the “Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Act”. The proposition was passed by California voters in November 2018 with 58% of the vote.\n\nThe act amends the state constitution to prohibit California from allowing betting on any type of race, including horse races, dog races, and auto races. In addition, the amendment bans all forms of gambling at casinos, card clubs, and racetracks. It does allow for raffles and “participation fee” bingo games to continue to be held at nonprofits such as churches and schools.\n\nSupporters of the proposition say that it will help create safe neighborhoods and schools by reducing crime associated with gambling. They also argue that it is important to protect children from being exposed to gambling at an early age.\n\nOpponents of the proposition say that it will result in job losses across the state and reduce tax revenue that is used to fund public programs. They also argue that adults should be able to make their own decision about whether or not to gamble.\n\nThe new law goes into effect on January 1, 2019.\n\n#  California Picks 21 as Gambling Age\n\nCalifornians voted on Tuesday to keep the legal gambling age at 21. Proposition 21, which required a majority vote to pass, would have allowed people 18 and over to gamble in casinos, play the lottery, and bet on horse races.\n\nThe measure's defeat means that California will remain one of six states with a legal gambling age of 21. The other states are Alabama, Nebraska, Utah, Nevada, and Hawaii.\n\nSupporters of Proposition 21 said that it would generate $1 billion in new tax revenue annually. But opponents argued that the measure would lead to more compulsive gambling and social problems.\n\nEven if the proposition had passed, there was no guarantee that any new casinos or race tracks would have been built in California. The state's gaming industry is currently in decline, with most of the casinos located in Indian reservations.\n\n#  California sticking with 21 as gambling age\n\nAfter months of debating the issue, lawmakers in California have come to a consensus that they will not be raising the gambling age from 21. Gambling has been a part of California’s culture for many years, and lawmakers feel that it is important to keep the legal gambling age at 21 in order to protect consumer safety.\n\nSome people argue that the legal gambling age should be raised to protect young people from developing gambling addictions at an early age. However, many lawmakers feel that it is more important to educate young people about the risks of gambling and provide resources for those who may have developed a gambling addiction.\n\nIn addition to protecting consumer safety, keeping the legal gambling age at 21 also helps to generate revenue for the state government. Taxes on gambling generate millions of dollars each year, which helps to fund important programs and services.\n\nUltimately, lawmakers in California feel that there are benefits to keeping the legal gambling age at 21. They will continue to work hard to make sure that consumers are protected and that revenue is generated for the state government.\n\n#  California extends gambling age to 21\n\nThe state of California has voted to extend the legal gambling age from 18 to 21. The new law, which was passed on September 4th and will come into effect on January 1st, 2019, will apply to all forms of gambling, including casino games, lottery tickets, and sports betting.\n\nSupporters of the bill argued that it would help protect young people from the dangers of gambling addiction, while opponents claimed that it would result in lost tax revenue for the state. Governor Jerry Brown has not yet indicated whether he will sign the bill into law.\n\nThis is not the first time that California has raised the gambling age; in 1984, the legal age was increased from 21 to 18. However, this is the first time that it has been raised across all forms of gambling.\n\nThe move comes as a number of other states are also considering increasing their gambling ages. In Nevada, for example, there is growing pressure to raise the legal age from 21 to 25.\n\nSome experts believe that raising the gambling age could help reduce rates of problem gambling. According to a study by the University of Michigan’s Institute for Social Research, problem gambling rates are twice as high among 18-21 year olds than among those aged 22 or older.\n\nOthers argue that young people will simply find ways to gamble illegally if the legal age is raised. A report by Global Betting and Gaming Consultants (GBGC) found that more than a third of British teenagers had gambled illegally in 2016.","source":"_posts/California-Gambling-Age-Set-at-18.md","raw":"---\ntitle: California Gambling Age Set at 18\ndate: 2022-10-17 12:27:45\ncategories:\n- Casino Game\ntags:\n---\n\n\n#  California Gambling Age Set at 18\n\nThe gambling age in California is 18 years old.

The CGCC is a state agency that regulates all aspects of gambling in California. The commission sets the gambling age at 18, and also regulates the games, casinos, and other gambling establishments in the state.\n\nThe commission has a number of responsibilities, including:\n\n- Regulating the operation of casinos\n- Licensing gaming employees and tribal gaming facilities\n- Investigating potential violations of gambling laws\n- Administering charitable gaming activities\n\nThe commission also provides educational resources on responsible gambling for both players and operators.\n\nThe gambling age in California is one of the lowest in the United States. Only two states have a lower minimum age - Nebraska and Arizona, which both have a minimum age of 17. Most states have a minimum age of 21.\n\nSome people argue that the minimum age should be raised to 21, as this would help protect citizens from the potential harms of gambling. However, others argue that 18 is an appropriate age, as it allows young adults to participate in legal gambling activities under supervision.\n\nUltimately, it is up to the individual states to decide what their minimum gambling age should be.\n\n#  You Must be 21 to Gamble in California\n\nAs of January 1, 2019, in order to gamble in the state of California you must be 21 years of age or older. This new law was enacted as a result of Proposition 6, also known as the “Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Act”. The proposition was passed by California voters in November 2018 with 58% of the vote.\n\nThe act amends the state constitution to prohibit California from allowing betting on any type of race, including horse races, dog races, and auto races. In addition, the amendment bans all forms of gambling at casinos, card clubs, and racetracks. It does allow for raffles and “participation fee” bingo games to continue to be held at nonprofits such as churches and schools.\n\nSupporters of the proposition say that it will help create safe neighborhoods and schools by reducing crime associated with gambling. They also argue that it is important to protect children from being exposed to gambling at an early age.\n\nOpponents of the proposition say that it will result in job losses across the state and reduce tax revenue that is used to fund public programs. They also argue that adults should be able to make their own decision about whether or not to gamble.\n\nThe new law goes into effect on January 1, 2019.\n\n#  California Picks 21 as Gambling Age\n\nCalifornians voted on Tuesday to keep the legal gambling age at 21. Proposition 21, which required a majority vote to pass, would have allowed people 18 and over to gamble in casinos, play the lottery, and bet on horse races.\n\nThe measure's defeat means that California will remain one of six states with a legal gambling age of 21. The other states are Alabama, Nebraska, Utah, Nevada, and Hawaii.\n\nSupporters of Proposition 21 said that it would generate $1 billion in new tax revenue annually. But opponents argued that the measure would lead to more compulsive gambling and social problems.\n\nEven if the proposition had passed, there was no guarantee that any new casinos or race tracks would have been built in California. The state's gaming industry is currently in decline, with most of the casinos located in Indian reservations.\n\n#  California sticking with 21 as gambling age\n\nAfter months of debating the issue, lawmakers in California have come to a consensus that they will not be raising the gambling age from 21. Gambling has been a part of California’s culture for many years, and lawmakers feel that it is important to keep the legal gambling age at 21 in order to protect consumer safety.\n\nSome people argue that the legal gambling age should be raised to protect young people from developing gambling addictions at an early age. However, many lawmakers feel that it is more important to educate young people about the risks of gambling and provide resources for those who may have developed a gambling addiction.\n\nIn addition to protecting consumer safety, keeping the legal gambling age at 21 also helps to generate revenue for the state government. Taxes on gambling generate millions of dollars each year, which helps to fund important programs and services.\n\nUltimately, lawmakers in California feel that there are benefits to keeping the legal gambling age at 21. They will continue to work hard to make sure that consumers are protected and that revenue is generated for the state government.\n\n#  California extends gambling age to 21\n\nThe state of California has voted to extend the legal gambling age from 18 to 21. The new law, which was passed on September 4th and will come into effect on January 1st, 2019, will apply to all forms of gambling, including casino games, lottery tickets, and sports betting.\n\nSupporters of the bill argued that it would help protect young people from the dangers of gambling addiction, while opponents claimed that it would result in lost tax revenue for the state. Governor Jerry Brown has not yet indicated whether he will sign the bill into law.\n\nThis is not the first time that California has raised the gambling age; in 1984, the legal age was increased from 21 to 18. However, this is the first time that it has been raised across all forms of gambling.\n\nThe move comes as a number of other states are also considering increasing their gambling ages. In Nevada, for example, there is growing pressure to raise the legal age from 21 to 25.\n\nSome experts believe that raising the gambling age could help reduce rates of problem gambling. According to a study by the University of Michigan’s Institute for Social Research, problem gambling rates are twice as high among 18-21 year olds than among those aged 22 or older.\n\nOthers argue that young people will simply find ways to gamble illegally if the legal age is raised. A report by Global Betting and Gaming Consultants (GBGC) found that more than a third of British teenagers had gambled illegally in 2016.","slug":"California-Gambling-Age-Set-at-18","published":1,"updated":"2022-10-17T04:27:45.780Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cl9c9zsve0000tcv5hfhyhtne","content":"<h1 id=\"California-Gambling-Age-Set-at-18\"><a href=\"#California-Gambling-Age-Set-at-18\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"California Gambling Age Set at 18\"></a>California Gambling Age Set at 18</h1><p>The gambling age in California is 18 years old.

Only 17 percent said they would be more likely to gamble online.\n\n\"What we're seeing is that people trust their local casinos more,\" said Allan Gregg, chairman of Pollara Strategic Insights. \"They see them as being more regulated, safer and with better odds.\"\n\nThe findings are in line with those of a similar study conducted last year by the firm, which also found that Ontarians preferred physical casinos to online gambling.\n\nThe OLG has been proactive in trying to address concerns about gambling addiction and fraud in the online space. In January, it announced plans to spend $15 million on a new advertising campaign aimed at educating players about the risks associated with online gambling.\n\n\"This research confirms that Ontarians prefer the safety and security of playing at our land-based casinos,\" said Rod Phillips, chairman and CEO of OLG. \"We will continue to focus our efforts on creating an enjoyable gaming experience while protecting players from undue harm.\"\n\n#  ONLINE GAMBLING LARGELY MORE POPULAR THAN ONTARIO CASINOS \n\nAround the world, online gambling is a multi-billion dollar industry. And while brick and mortar casinos remain popular in Ontario, online gambling is growing faster here than at any other point in history.\n\nThis is according to a report released by the Canadian Gaming Association (CGA) in February of this year. The report states that, in 2017, Canadians wagered more than $22.5 billion on gaming products – of which $18.9 billion was gambled online.\n\nThe trend looks likely to continue; in 2018, more than half of all spending on gambling in Canada is expected to take place online.\n\nWhy is online gambling so popular? There are many reasons: convenience, anonymity, and the wide variety of games available are among the top reasons cited by gamers themselves.\n\nConvenience is a huge factor; with just a few clicks of a mouse or taps on a screen, you can be playing your favourite casino game from the comfort of your own home. No need to dress up, no need to fight traffic, and no need to wait for a table – you can start playing immediately.\n\nAnonymity is another big draw; unlike at a physical casino where you’re surrounded by other players and staff members, online casinos allow you to play in complete privacy. Nobody will know if you hit a bad streak or if you’re winning big – unless you want them to know!\n\nAnd finally, the variety of games available online is staggering. Whether you’re into slot machines, blackjack, poker, or any other casino game, you’ll be able to find it online. Plus there are now live-dealer games available too; giving you the opportunity to experience all the excitement of a real-life casino without ever leaving your living room!\n\n#  ONTARIO CASINO REVENUES FALLING WHILE ONLINE GAMBLING REVENUES RISE \n\nOntario’s casino revenues have been in a steady decline for the past few years. This is in sharp contrast to the rapid growth of online gambling revenues, which have more than doubled in the same period. What could account for this divergence?\n\nIt could be that Ontarians are simply preferring to gamble online rather than go to casinos. This would be understandable given that online gambling is more convenient and allows players to bet on a wider range of games. Additionally, online casinos often offer better odds and bigger jackpots than their brick-and-mortar counterparts.\n\nAnother possible explanation is that the increased competition from online casinos is cannibalizing revenue from land-based casinos. This theory is supported by the fact that the decline in casino revenue has been particularly pronounced in regions where there is also an active online gambling market.\n\nWhatever the explanation may be, it is clear that Ontario’s casino industry is in trouble. This raises questions about the future of these venues and their ability to generate meaningful tax revenue for the province.\n\n#  ONLINE GAMBLING NOW MAJORITY FORM OF GAMBLING IN ONTARIO \n\nOntario’s gambling landscape is changing. A new study from the Ontario Problem Gambling Research Centre (OPGRC) shows that online gambling is now the majority form of gambling in the province.\n\nThe study, which looked at gambling behaviour among adults in Ontario between 2009 and 2016, found that 53% of people reported engaging in at least one form of online gambling in the past year. This was a significant increase from 39% in 2009.\n\nIn contrast, the use of land-based casinos, lotteries and horse racing decreased over the same period.\n\nThe study’s lead author, Dr. Anil Jain, said that the findings were not surprising, as online gambling has been growing steadily around the world.\n\n“What we are seeing is a shift from traditional forms of gambling to more electronic forms of gambling, and this is especially true for younger people,” said Jain.\n\nOnline gambling can include activities such as betting on sports or casino games, playing poker or bingo online, or buying lottery tickets online. It can be done on a computer or mobile device from anywhere in the province.\n\nThe OPGRC study also found that those who reported problem gambling behaviour were more likely to engage in online gambling than land-based gambling. In particular, those who exhibited signs of severe problem gambling were six times more likely to gamble online than those without signs of problem gambling.\n\nJain said that this highlights the importance of prevention and education programs targeting young people about the risks associated with online gambling.\n\n“It is important for people to be aware of the risks associated with online gambling, especially given that it is so easily accessible and can be addictive,” he said.\n\n#  RESEARCH SHOWS THAT ONLINE GAMBLERS ARE GENERALLY BETTER AT IT THAN CASINO PLAYERS\n\nA study published in the journal “Psychology of Addictive Behaviors” has found that online gamblers are better at it than casino players. The research was conducted by a team at the University of Waterloo in Canada.\n\nThe study looked at two groups of people – those who gambled online and those who gambled at casinos. The aim of the study was to determine if there was a difference between the two groups in terms of their ability to make successful bets.\n\nThe results of the study showed that online gamblers were better at making successful bets than casino players. This is thought to be due to the fact that online gamblers have more experience making bets and are more comfortable with gambling overall.\n\nOnline gambling has become increasingly popular in recent years, and this study provides evidence that it is not only fun and exciting, but also potentially profitable. So if you’re looking for a way to make some extra money, consider giving online gambling a try!","source":"_posts/ONTARIO-CASINO-MORE-POPULAR-THAN-ONLINE-GAMBLING-.md","raw":"---\ntitle: ONTARIO CASINO MORE POPULAR THAN ONLINE GAMBLING \ndate: 2022-10-18 12:51:29\ncategories:\n- Online Gambling\ntags:\n---\n\n\n#  ONTARIO CASINO MORE POPULAR THAN ONLINE GAMBLING \n\nOntario residents are increasingly opting for brick-and-mortar casinos over online gambling, a new study has found.\n\nThe study, conducted by the research firm Pollara Strategic Insights on behalf of the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation (OLG), suggests that Ontarians are growing wary of the risks associated with online gambling.\n\nAccording to the poll, more than 60 percent of respondents said they would be less likely to gamble online than in a physical casino.

Let us know in the comments below!\n\n#  Casino stands up for disabled man, denies underage patron access to Cave Raiders HD game \n\nThe management of a popular casino in Las Vegas is standing up for a disabled man who was allegedly denied access to a game because of his disability. The man, who has not been identified, suffers from a condition that leaves him unable to walk without assistance. When he and his caretaker attempted to play the Cave Raiders HD game at the casino, they were told by a staff member that the game was for \"people who can walk.\"\n\nThe casino's management has issued a statement denying that any such policy exists, and has even offered the disabled man and his caretaker complimentary tickets to any game of their choice.

Some have called for a boycott of the casino. However, others have defended the casino's decision, saying that it was necessary to protect the disabled man.\n\nWhat do you think?

This decision was met with criticism from some members of the community, but ultimately, the casino put safety first.</p>\n"}],"PostAsset":[],"PostCategory":[{"post_id":"cl6xjh0b10001ggv5feswdslh","category_id":"cl6xjh0b50003ggv57856d4bl","_id":"cl6xjh0b70004ggv516393o86"},{"post_id":"cl8a2j9m10000lcv5d2h3g04m","category_id":"cl8a2j9m70001lcv5d1k45cw8","_id":"cl8a2j9ma0004lcv5hoxze7yq"},{"post_id":"cl8d1u7170000ecv5cidpguvg","category_id":"cl8d1u71f0001ecv57em4g8u2","_id":"cl8d1u71h0002ecv5adcg3nu8"},{"post_id":"cl8joijvx00000sv5drgi41d1","category_id":"cl8d1u71f0001ecv57em4g8u2","_id":"cl8joijwf00010sv5er2oacyb"},{"post_id":"cl8l9i3i400006sv5bsdm5yk1","category_id":"cl8d1u71f0001ecv57em4g8u2","_id":"cl8l9i3if00016sv5dr07ads0"},{"post_id":"cl8v36ebb0000uwv51nw0gcwg","category_id":"cl8v36ebh0001uwv5f14dcqk7","_id":"cl8v36ebo0002uwv55k7n68so"},{"post_id":"cl8wlkads0000nkv5ao1s93qv","category_id":"cl8v36ebh0001uwv5f14dcqk7","_id":"cl8wlkady0001nkv54tjvfhji"},{"post_id":"cl8yap0kk0000hkv5bvk89nef","category_id":"cl8yap0kp0001hkv5cygq24j9","_id":"cl8yap0kr0002hkv5bekl0960"},{"post_id":"cl92cxq8g0000swv5aadx2ent","category_id":"cl92cxq8r0001swv5gsdw69tr","_id":"cl92cxq8x0002swv5fsns94f0"},{"post_id":"cl9c9zsve0000tcv5hfhyhtne","category_id":"cl9c9zsvk0001tcv5bd3bepfn","_id":"cl9c9zsvp0002tcv56n3ifnk0"},{"post_id":"cl9dqa5o20000h8v5eq4l7f3w","category_id":"cl9dqa5o70001h8v5dx010n2c","_id":"cl9dqa5oa0002h8v5eotv3mtq"},{"post_id":"cl9qo00ca00001kv5ah1g31cd","category_id":"cl9dqa5o70001h8v5dx010n2c","_id":"cl9qo00cm00021kv5h94a237b"},{"post_id":"cl9rmepec00008gv53uz8agph","category_id":"cl9rmepej00018gv5fpcde0tc","_id":"cl9rmepeo00028gv5at5ohi5d"}],"PostTag":[{"post_id":"cl8a2j9m10000lcv5d2h3g04m","tag_id":"cl8a2j9m90002lcv5bb7906p5","_id":"cl8a2j9mb0006lcv5dh2b05nb"},{"post_id":"cl8a2j9m10000lcv5d2h3g04m","tag_id":"cl8a2j9m90003lcv57jr4ffu5","_id":"cl8a2j9mb0007lcv5dy5xd4n9"},{"post_id":"cl8a2j9m10000lcv5d2h3g04m","tag_id":"cl8a2j9ma0005lcv54dgr5h3b","_id":"cl8a2j9mb0008lcv55cvrfn5h"},{"post_id":"cl9qo00ca00001kv5ah1g31cd","tag_id":"cl9qo00ch00011kv57tuye99h","_id":"cl9qo00cp00071kv58vde5cnw"},{"post_id":"cl9qo00ca00001kv5ah1g31cd","tag_id":"cl9qo00cn00031kv5ejhp095i","_id":"cl9qo00cq00081kv5gfmq1r45"},{"post_id":"cl9qo00ca00001kv5ah1g31cd","tag_id":"cl9qo00co00041kv513kqfa17","_id":"cl9qo00cq00091kv52lrtdh9v"},{"post_id":"cl9qo00ca00001kv5ah1g31cd","tag_id":"cl9qo00co00051kv52nf96ixt","_id":"cl9qo00cq000a1kv581386r16"},{"post_id":"cl9qo00ca00001kv5ah1g31cd","tag_id":"cl9qo00cp00061kv5gazs9s4i","_id":"cl9qo00cq000b1kv52vyw78tp"}],"Tag":[{"name":"Photo","_id":"cl8a2j9m90002lcv5bb7906p5"},{"name":"Photograph","_id":"cl8a2j9m90003lcv57jr4ffu5"},{"name":"Photography","_id":"cl8a2j9ma0005lcv54dgr5h3b"},{"name":"Online Gambling","_id":"cl9qo00ch00011kv57tuye99h"},{"name":"Slot machine","_id":"cl9qo00cn00031kv5ejhp095i"},{"name":"Toto Casino","_id":"cl9qo00co00041kv513kqfa17"},{"name":"Online Games","_id":"cl9qo00co00051kv52nf96ixt"},{"name":"Online Casino","_id":"cl9qo00cp00061kv5gazs9s4i"}]}}
